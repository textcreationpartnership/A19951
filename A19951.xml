            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOVGH worldly men, whoſe ſoules are ſwallowed vp in ſenſe, be content to make their purſe of gold their God, by occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>S. Paul</hi> thought good to ſay, that couetouſnes was no beter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a kind of ſacrifice to Idols: yet ſuch as are not wholy deafe to the voyce of reaſon, may heare it proteſt, that as man is compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of fleſh &amp; ſpirit, ſo his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall goods are inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably ſuperiour to the corporall, and that riches are to be held of the meaneſt &amp; low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ranke, among all ſuch benefits as God Almighty hath vouchſafed to mankind. For as thoſe thinges which men haue any colour to account their owne,
<pb facs="tcp:17172:3"/>are eyther plenty of fortune, health of body, glory of reputation, or laſtly the ſoule it ſelfe; ſo, who is he that will not empty his purſe to recouer his health, or ſaue his life? What man of worth will not deſpiſe his life to preſerue his honour? And who doubteth but that the reſpect of honour ſhould yeild vnto the care which a man ought to haue of his ſoule? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon may be grounded, amongst others, two appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent truthes; The one, that for the ſoule a man is to deſpiſe all other things; the other, that except the ſoule, there is nothing ſo deare as reputation. Now, if reputation be ſo precious, for as much as concerns the morall man, what accompt ought Chriſtians to haue it in, ſince ſcandals are often giuen and taken, vpon the aboundance or defect thereof; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vpon the credit of a few, dependeth the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of very many. The enemy of mankinde who knowes how true this is, hath continually laboured to rob Gods ſeruantes of ſo great a Iewell; yea and hath preſumed to infame God himſelfe, beeing made man for vs; ſometimes tempting men to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him as a Coniurer, ſometimes as a Samaritane, which did import a Schiſmatike, and ſometimes as a trayterous and ſeditious perſon. The ſame ſtile he held with the Chriſtians of the Primitiue Church, and we Engliſh Catholikes of this age, whoſe cauſe is the ſame with theirs, haue lyen groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning long vnder the ſame burthen, and felt with vnſpeakable griefe, though with vndaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the poyſoned arrowes of this kinde, which he hath beene dayly ſhooting into our ſides.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:17172:3"/>
            <p> Thoſe Aduerſaries of our cauſe who beleeue in God but for faſhion-ſake, at leaſt conceaue that it importes not after what faſhion he be ſerued, think they do vs a fauour, when they call vs fooles, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our ſelues to perſecution vpon the differences of Catholike and proteſtant Religion. Such Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as in good earneſt belieue that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they profeſſe, are wont to traduce vs for ſupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Idolatrous perſons, vnder the pretence of our doctrines which concerne the Reall preſence, and the reuerent vſe which we make of Images: But they who vſe their Religion no more then for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, or rather ſlaue to their abſurd reaſon of ſtate, and know well inough that if they ſhould perſecute vs vnder the only title of Heretikes, they muſt be faine both to diſclayme from the Society of al ancient Chriſtians, and ſhould be forced to deſerue the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſauage cruelty, for preſuming to condemne that faith, to which their aunceſtours and ours were conuerted from Paganiſme: they, I ſay, are the men who giue out, that we are not vniuſtly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our religion, but iuſtly puniſhed for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, diſobedience, and treaſon.</p>
            <p>For the painting ouer of which diſcourſe, how many induſtries haue beene vſed; how many Iewels and Cupbordes of plate to forraine Princes &amp; Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours haue beene preſented; how many crafty and cruell lawes haue beene at ſeuerall times procured &amp; enacted; and laſtly what a couple of daungerous and deteſtable. <hi>Oathes,</hi> vnder the authority of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid lawes, haue with extreme rigour, &amp; without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb facs="tcp:17172:4"/>of ſexe or age, byn propounded &amp; exacted?</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe <hi>Oathes,</hi> is that of the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> deuiſed heretofore by our Aduerſaries for the making of all Catholikes expreſſe Traytours, and executed for a while with great ſeuerity, though afterwardes they grew halfe aſhamed therof. And the vſe which it affoardes at this day, is chiefly to diſtinguiſh ſuch perſons, as adore the preſent ſtate of thinges, from others who are more indifferent: and ſo we ſee it is ordinarily miniſtred, but to ſuch, as either pretend to make Lawes by voice in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or els to cary Office in the Common wealth or Church. Alwaies that <hi>Oath</hi> ſerued rather to other endes, then to make diuiſion, or procure mutuall ſcandalls among Engliſh Catholikes, ſince we all agree in the cleere deteſtation therof; and for this later purpoſe, the other <hi>Oath,</hi> which is called of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> was ſet on foot, by the inſtigation of ſome <hi>Miniſters,</hi> immediatly after the powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if euery one that did refuſe to take it, were guilty of that prodigious plot. Withall, it was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in ſuch cunning and myſty termes, as ſome Prieſtes (yea euen ſince the Pope condemned it) haue not beene aſhamed to take it, and more lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes haue beene led on by their bad example. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theirs, hath implied a kind, of diſloyalty in them that refuſed the ſame; and the <hi>State</hi> hath not beene a little carefull to publiſh the brute therof, both within and without the Realme, to the extreme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage, and diſcomfort of all ſincere and ſolide Catholikes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:17172:4"/>
            <p> There hath not beene a greater meanes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ſtrengthning of fowle aſperſions vpon vs, then the confidence which our Aduerſaries, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> haue vſed in proteſting, that we Engliſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes who refuſe the <hi>Oath,</hi> are controlled by many great partes of Chriſtendome, euen Catholike, where men would vndoubtedly (ſay they) haue taken ſuch an <hi>Oath</hi> as this, if they were required thereunto by their ſeuerall Princes. In particuler the example of <hi>France</hi> hath beene euery day obtruded to vs, as if the Catholike parte of that Kingdome were wholy of the Engliſh Proteſtant faith in this particuler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And although this vndertaking of theirs, were knowne to be impudent and moſt vntrue, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of ſome Engliſh Catholikes, who informed themſelues of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> which is the Diuinity, Schoole of <hi>Paris,</hi> and found that it abhor'd the <hi>Oath;</hi> yet partly by the confident aſſeuerations of our aduerſaryes, partly by the corrupt beliefe in that point, which ſome one of the Ambaſſadours of that Countrey, reſiding heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> was faln to, and the flattering diſcourſe which for hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was wont to hold; ſo it is that the ordinary ſort of Proteſtants conceaued all this while, that <hi>French</hi> Catholikes were in this poynt agreeing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Parlament in <hi>England,</hi> then the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, God be praiſed, the curtaine is drawne at length, which heretofore hath parted the ſtage from the attyring houſe, and now the ſpectatours (who are as many of our Country, as can write and

            <p>The <hi>Parlaments</hi> in <hi>France</hi> haue no reſemblance to ours in <hi>England,</hi> but are certaine ſedentary and ſupreme Courts of Iuſtice, compounded only of Lawyers, who iudge without appeale within their ſeuerall precinctes of Iuriſdiction. Of theſe Courtes there are eight in <hi>France,</hi> all independant on of

That which in <hi>France</hi> doth answere the nature of our <hi>Engliſh Parlament,</hi> is the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the three <hi>Eſtates Generall,</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the <hi>Communalty</hi> (which laſt is called the Third <hi>Eſtate;</hi>) but it is with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, amongſt others, that they ſit in three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chambers, whereas the two former of ours ſit in one and wheras, with vs, an Act is not preſented to the King, vnles the maior part of both our Houſes or Chambers do finde it good; in France if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior part of two Chambers do reſolue vpon any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it is to go vnder the name of all the Three Eſtates, although one of them ſhould diſſent therin.</p>
            <p>This ſuppoſed, I wil proceed to informe thee, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, that the greater number of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the third Chamber, in this laſt Aſſembly of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> did conceaue, &amp; frame the forme of an <hi>Oath,</hi> which they wiſhed might be miniſtred in that Kingdome, as that which beares the name of <hi>Allegiance</hi> is in ours; whereby the ſame principall Article is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y for the credit of our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> that they of the <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which is the greateſt member of that body, ſhould c nſpire in
<pb facs="tcp:17172:7"/>opinion with the Authours of our <hi>Engliſh Oath,</hi> though they be of a contrary Religion to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in other thinges, and eſteemed the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout profeſſours of it in that Kingdome. I anſwere that this argument may looke fayre a far off, but with ſuch as know how thinges were carried, it will fall out to be of no force at all.</p>
            <p>It is to be vnderſtood, that this Chamber of the <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> was wholy, in effect, compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Lawyers, (moſt of them belonging to the Court of Parlament of <hi>Paris</hi>) and certaine Officers of the Long Robe, belonging to the King, as Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Receauers, and ſuch like; who commonly bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefeſt men of their Pariſh, are wont with ſuch caſe to procure themſelues to be choſen deputies, as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman of meanes and credit, can make himſelfe in like caſe be made a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe. By this meanes there were very few places in the <hi>Third Chamber,</hi> which were filled by <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> or ſubſtantiall <hi>Merchants</hi> of thoſe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Prouinces, and therefore no meruayle, if vnder the name of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who are perhaps of the moſt pious men of that Kingdome (and whereof there was in this Aſſembly of <hi>Eſtates</hi> no more in effect but the name) this wicked propoſition of a profane <hi>Oath</hi> did come to light, beeing conceaued partly by the Kinges Officers (who crept into thoſe places, expreſly againſt the Lawes of <hi>France,</hi> and who make no ſcruple to flatter their King with faire words, vpon condition they may the more ſecurely robbe him by other,
<pb facs="tcp:17172:7"/>meanes;) and partly by certaine other Lawyers, as hath beene ſaid, who vſe to be wel content to deliuer the King from all Tribunalls but their owne, and are generally the greateſt Libertines both in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, that perhaps the Chriſtian world is acquainted with.</p>
            <p>This action therefore of the <hi>Third Eſtate</hi> being thus miſcompounded, need not make our Aduerſaries more inſolent then they were before; but much rather ought they to retract their former actions vpon a due conſideration of the proceeding, which was held in this buſines, by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of whome it cannot be pretended, but that they would gladly haue graunted to their King, whatſoeuer they could in conſcience. The <hi>Clergy</hi> I ſay of <hi>France,</hi> which dependeth more vpon thoſe Kinges by the exemptions of ſundry Popes, then any Catholike <hi>Clergy</hi> doth in Chriſtendome; and the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France</hi> which enioyeth not only more acceſſe, &amp; other priuileges, but draweth more money <hi>in ſpecie</hi> by way of penſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their King, without obligation to any particuler reſidence, or ſeruice, then any <hi>Nobility</hi> doth in Chriſtendome, whether it be Catholike, or other; wherin I will not except <hi>Spayne,</hi> for I know I need not. And when I ſhould ſay, that the French King di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Oration</hi> it ſelf doth follow at the end of this Preface, and therefore I enter not vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers thereof; only the Reader, when he hath peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, may be pleaſed to remember two thinges in generall conteyned therein. One, that the <hi>Oath</hi> is ſuch, as that they of the <hi>French Clergie</hi> and <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will rather die then take it; the other, that there was neuer any <hi>French</hi> writer, ſince the faculty of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</hi> hath beene taught in the Schooles of <hi>France</hi> (not excepting euen ſuch as were the moſt earneſt vpholders of Regal authority, &amp; were required by the Kinges of their tymes, to defend the ſame by publique writing) who affirmeth Kinges to be indepoſable by Popes in al caſes. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer any of them haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the point of the <hi>Abſolution,</hi> which ſubiectes may haue from the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> the caſes of the Princes <hi>Hereſy</hi> &amp; <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> are alwayes excepted; that is to ſay, in ſuch caſes, the ſubiects of a King, acording to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all Catholike <hi>French</hi> writers, may be abſolued from the <hi>Oath</hi> of their <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tie not my ſelf to the wordes, but the ſubſtance of theſe two propoſitions is cleerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> which ſo long as the Reader ſhall keep in mind, it will make him (if he be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Proteſtant) diſcerne with eaſe, how falſly his Miniſters haue laid certaine ſeditious opinions to the charge of vs <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholikes, and ſuch (ſay they) as are not belieued by the Catholike Countries
<pb facs="tcp:17172:8"/>ioyning to vs. If he chaunce to be a Preciſian, he will haue reaſon to take compaſſion of vs Catholikes, whome he findes to agree in this with himſelfe, and all the <hi>Calumiſts</hi> in the world, that Kings may for ſome hideous crymes deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rue to fall from their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; though there be this difference betweene vs, that we hold the common Father of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to be the fitteſt Iudge of ſuch high quarrells, as fall out betweene his children (wherin alſo he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Canons and inuiolable Cuſtomes of the Church, in what ſort, and by what degrees he muſt proceed) but they hold that Kinges are ſubiect to a kinde of popular iudgment, which is ſo much the likelier to be corrupt, as it is vſuall for the people whome they make the Iudge, to be a party. If he be a faint Catholike who hath brought his conſcience to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to run dauncing round the may-pole of humane reſpectes, it will make him returne to the good company, which in that point he hath left, and fetch the bloud into his face, when he conſiders that he beeing an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, who was wont to haue the honour to be ſo entire in the confeſſion of his faith, hath need to be put in mind of his duty, by an action performed in <hi>France,</hi> where leuity and liberty are ordinarily ſo much in vſe. If laſtly he he a ſincere and loyal Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, who doth chooſe rather to ſtarue, then to ſtrayne his conſcience, and conſequently reſolueth to be far inough from taking the <hi>Engliſh Oath,</hi> he may giue God humble thankes for his infinite mercy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the promiſe of future rewardes, for theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:17172:9"/>ſufferinges, and the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which, euen in this life, is ſo great a Iewell as both the <hi>Indies</hi> cannot buy, hath vouchſafed to iuſtify him in point of ſpirituall reputation, by the teſtimony of that Nation, whoſe ſyncerity was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moſt in queſtion, and whoſe example hath been heretofore ſo impudently, though without controle, alleadged againſt him, and vs.</p>
            <p>And though if we were ſure that our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to continue as long as the world: yet we ſhould know withall, that there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the longeſt tyme and eternity; and that, the ſufferings of this life, though neuer ſo grieuous, are infinitly vnworthy of that glory, which is prepared for ſuch as keepe the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of Catholike Faith, vndiminiſht. But we are taught, not only by the experience of former tymes, which tells vs of the periode of great perſecutions, euen then when there ſeemed to be leaſt humane hope therof; but alſo by that which we may haue obſerued by the paſſages of the late action of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> how able God Almighty is, to make his greateſt enemies the liuelieſt inſtruments of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in deſpight of their owne wicked hartes, and to make their endeauours, which ayme at the diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and abuſing of his Church, to giue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt contribution that could be wiſhed, to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Maieſty of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Who knowes not, that the holding of theſe <hi>Eſtates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was purſued only, in effect, by certaine irreuerent ſemi-Catholikes, who loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               </gap>uriſdiction? Who knowes not, that as ſoone as the ſaid <hi>Eſtates</hi> were opened, that rotten member which tooke the name of the <hi>Third Eſtate,</hi> diſcouered that Canker, which hath been feeding gredily vpon it (eſpecially ſince the introduction of hereſy into that Kingdome) by plodding vpon ſome courſe, how to make an Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet we ſee God hath fetcht the Treacle of which I haue ſpoken, from the poyſon that grew in the feſtred bowells of his Enemies; for if that <hi>French Oath</hi> had not been propounded by thoſe Lawyers, the contrary doctrine and beliefe of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> had not beene proteſted by thoſe Prelates. Shall the prouidence therefore of God, be able to watch ſo fruitfully ouer the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and ſhall the narrow ſeas be broad inough to keepe him from ſhewing his power in <hi>England</hi> to our comfort, and the confuſion of ſuch, as either know him not, or care not for him? nay rather let vs learne by this, that when our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Miniſters do moſt conſpire our ruine, then ſhall we be ſureſt of Gods preſent help; &amp; when the graue ſhalbe finiſhed wherin they hope to bury vs aliue, <hi>incident in foueam quam fecerunt,</hi> it is then that they are likelieſt to die in the ſame ditch which they made for vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:17172:10"/>
            <p> Courage therfore is that which we are to beg at the hands of God, who knowes not how to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, but ſuch as confide not in him It was ſaid long ago by one who had no ſupernaturall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neceſſarily
<pb facs="tcp:17172:11"/>I ſay implied for ſuppoſing, that a people who was without queſtion the firſt owner of ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vpon earth ſhould cauſe a King to gouerne them without obliging him in particuler to do this, or that, it were a Barbarous conceipt to thinke that it were in his law full power, to Tyrannize ouer them at his pleaſure, without hauing reſpect either to their defence in time of warre, or the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Iuſtice in tyme of peace, for which only reſpectes they made him King. If this diſcourſe be true in caſe of Kinges, euen by the Law of Nature and of Nations; how much more ſhall it be ſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Christian Kinges, who in their Baptiſme do their homage to the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and at their Coronations do ſweare the mayntenance of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which are the conditions expreſſed, whereupon the progenitours of the moſt abſolute Christian Kinges, were placed in their Royall Throne. Theſe thinges, I ſay, are growne into the conſideration of men, and ſtrikes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable part of their ſoules with ſuch an euidence and demonstration of truth, as no formulary of an Oath, though perhaps for feare, or faſhion ſake they may chance to accept therof, will euer be able to wipe out.</p>
            <p>Some queſtions there may be, betweene men of different Religions (as hath beene toucht) to whom the iudgment ouer <hi>Kings</hi> for their offences may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; ſome holding that this <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> reſides in the <hi>Church;</hi> ſome in the <hi>Common Wealth;</hi> ſome in both together; and ſome others other ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:17172:11"/>opinions, which are not ſo much worth the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; but all the Chriſtian Congregations of all Religions in the world do agree in this, that all Kinges for hideous crimes may fall from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and their ſubiectes may be abſolued from their <hi>Oath</hi> of fidelity. Nay I haue not heard euen in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> was enacted, nor in <hi>France</hi> where the like was offered, that when the generall propoſitions which were conteyned in both the formularies were well deduced into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, men would be drawne to ſubſcribe and ſweare thereto (otherwiſe then forced by feare) excepting only a few hypocritical Miniſters amongſt vs, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Lawyers amongſt our neighbours. But as God would haue it, neither the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are of that opinion (for they profeſſe the contrary) nor yet the <hi>Lawyers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if you put the caſe home to them: for howſoeuer it coſtes them nothing to ſweare, that the Pope can neuer come to depoſe a King becauſe he is a proteſtant; it would trouble ſome of their conſciences, if they haue any, to ſweare that if an Vpper and Lower houſe of the <hi>Engliſh Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſhould condemne a King, who might happen to be ſo great a Tyrant, as that he would abrogate all the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Common Lawes</hi> of the Realme; bring in by force a ſummary courſe of Iuſtice, as is vſed in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> confiſcate all the Common Lawyers of <hi>England,</hi> who are able to ſpend aboue a thouſand poundes <hi>per annum;</hi> and in a word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their wiues and children, as if they were his owne; it would trouble them, I ſay, to ſweare, that
<pb facs="tcp:17172:12"/>ſuch a King might not be depoſed by the Houſes of <hi>Parlament,</hi> and that themſelues could not be ſo far diſcharged from the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which they made to him when they were ſworne Iuſtices of Peace, as to make ſome perſonall reſiſtance in their owne defence.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more certaine, then that many a man reades ouer the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and diuers take it, who conſider not the importance of thoſe fearefull generall clauſes, which include and exclude all particuler caſes of <hi>No Pope, No King, neither by his owne, nor by any other Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for any cauſe whatſoeuer, can Depoſe or Abſolue ſubiects &amp;c.</hi> And yet, as I ſaid before, there are ſo many Proteſtantes, who by occaſion of this <hi>Oath</hi> haue entred ſo deeply into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kingly Authority, as it is euident (to all ſuch as freely and familiarly liue with Proteſtantes, and vnderſtand ſincerely from them what they think) that thouſands of them are growne to a leſſe adoring conceipt of Royall Dignity, then they were wont to haue. And though his Maieſty can hardly come to know the preiudice that he hath ſuſteyned by yeilding to them, who haue vnfitly ſought to help him, or rather to help themſelues by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>Oath,</hi> becauſe he is a King, and cannot equally conuerſe with his ſubiectes, (nor can he from his ſeruantes expect but ſuch newes, as will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him) yet it may be hoped for, at the Handes of ſo Excellent a Iudgment as his Maieſty is endued withall, that he will one day fall vpon the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

Neither did he much wonder to ſee ſuch peeces of changeable colours clapt togeather, ſome true, ſome falſe, according vnto euery ones paſsion, without reſemblance to the originall: for he doth thinke that no pen could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor memory retayne two Speaches wherof the ſhorteſt laſted three houres, although ſwiftly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. But he was much aſtoniſhed at the liberty of this tyme, that within <hi>Paris</hi> (himſelfe being preſent) any ſhould publiſh two Speaches in his name without acquainting him with it, therby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whither he would acknowledge them for his owne. It is true indeed, that he was not the only

            <p>As ſoone as he had therefore ſignified to the Gentlemen of the Third Order, that being to ſpeake in their preſence, he thought himſelf obliged to make the ſame prayer to God, which <hi>Pericles</hi> was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do, being to ſpeake to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that nothing might paſſe from him vnbeſeeming thoſe that had imployed him, neyther of thoſe that were to heare him,

But that which did moſt aſſure vs, that you practiſed effectually what you gaue teſtimony of by wordes, was the laſt occaſion which preſented it ſelfe. For vpon the newes which was ſent vnto vs, of a certain article, touching the ſecurity of Kinges, intituled, a Fund a mentall Law propoſed &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued amongſt your ſelues, where there was matter of Religion mixt with intereſt of ſtate, you were contented to be perſwaded by the learned, and eloquent informations deliuered

            <p>For this cauſe <hi>(Gentlemen)</hi> the Eccleſiaſticall aſſembly hath choſen &amp; ſent me vnto you: Firſt to giue you thankes for the honour you pleaſed to do them heerin: then to let you vnderſtand their opinion concerning as wel the ſubſtance, as circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of your Article. And they haue eſpecially giuen me in charge aboue all other thinges to render you infinite thankes, and prayſe your zeale, in prouiding ſo carefully for the ſecurity of the life, and perſon of our Kinges; withall proteſting, that they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together with you in this thought, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary feeling of yours, and that from the bottome of their hartes and ſoules. For they lament, and ſhall neuer ceaſe mourning with teares of bloud, the tragicall, and deteſtable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinats, which haue wronged and defiled the memory of this age, with two ſo horrible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides; and do find in themſelues ſo much greater obligation to haue their hartes pierced with this grief, by how much more they muſt acknowledge themſelues tyed with ſtrayter bandes, then any other Orders, to mayntayne and ſtand affected to the Sacred Perſon of our Kinges. I meane not to enlarge my ſelfe for the preſent in telling you, how God hath put into their handes the light of his word, to lighten
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17172:17"/>other orders, and how the Clergie muſt march formoſt and direct others, by doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in ſeruing well and faithfully thoſe, whome God hath placed ouer his people: Only thus much out of meere humane conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; There is no profeſſion ſo ſtraitly bound, in all fidelity and loyalty to our Princes, as the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall. For other ſtates come to offices, honours, and dignities of the realme, ſome of them, as the Gentelmen &amp; Nobility, at the deareſt rate of all other, with loſſe of their bloud, and perill of their liues; others; beſides their merit, by contribution of ſome part of their goodes, and commodities. But as for vs, we atteyne them by the only grace and fauour of our Kinges, without hazard or imployment of ought, either of life, goods, or honours. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any other meanes (beeing as we are naked and vnarmed) can we enioy our quiet or commodities, but vnder the ſhaddow of the peaceable and proſperous affaires of the King, being otherwiſe expoſed as a prey to all ſortes of wronges and outrages. And therefore, what man of ſound iudgment can liue in doubt, but that we haue more intereſt, then any other in his conſeruation, in whoſe life, as within ſome fatall brand, all our liues and fortunes are comprized?</p>
            <p>Wee therefore alike ioyne iſſue with you in this your zeale and feruency of paſſion, and do alike condemne, nay more if poſſible
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17172:17"/>may be, the perfidious butchery of thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which dare aduenture on Sacred perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of Kinges. But with all deſiring you to enter into conſideration, that as the only lawes ſufficient to reſtaine thoſe who ſet at naught their liues, are the Eccleſiaſticall which curbe thoſe ſpirits, that contemne death with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thoſe paynes after death: So muſt we carefully take heed, not to inſert any thing into thoſe lawes, but that which is held for certaine, and vndoubted by the whole Church, for feare of diſabling the authority of that which is certaine &amp; infallible, by mixture of that which is doubtfull and in contention. For experience hath taught vs too well, that humane lawes only, and apprehenſion of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment can neuer ſerue for ſufficient remedy to ſuch euills, as proceed from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and corrupted imagination of Religion. We muſt haue therefore lawes of conſcience ſuch as work on our ſoules, and keep them in feare of eternall tormentes. Thoſe who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take theſe deteſtable parricides vnder a falſe per ſuaſion of Religion, are not kept back with any feare of corporall puniſhment; they bath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in tormentes with delight, they expect triumphes and Crownes of Martyrdome, they flatter themſelues with falſe application of that ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence of our Sauiour, <hi>do not feare them that can kill the body,</hi>

                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>but rather feare him that can ſend both ſoule and body into hell.</hi> So that to reſtrayne and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17172:18"/>terrify this kinde of people, we muſt lay before them, not ſuch lawes as are executed in this life, which they care not for, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue other men of theirs: but of ſuch lawes, whoſe rigour and ſeuerity are exacted after death, that is of lawes Eccleſiaſticall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. The <hi>Mileſian</hi> Virgins were poſſeſſed of ſo furious and prodigious hatred of their liues, that they ran voluntarily with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their deathes, they ſtrangled, threw themſelues downe headlong, and cut their owne throtes, the prayers and teares of their parentes not being able to hinder them. The Magiſtrates of the Iland oftentimes conſulted, and made many decrees to ſtop the publick mourning, but none of their deſignementes tooke effect. For they deſpiſing and hating life, entred likewiſe into contempt of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was ended with life, vntill in the end ſeeing all other meanes to fayle them, agreed to publiſh a law, whereby all thoſe which volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily made away themſelues, ſhould be drawne openly through the ſtreets, &amp; that ſtark naked after their death: Then the frenzie, which all theſe remedies applied during life could not cure, the apprehenſion of ſhameful puniſhment after death did remedy. The like is to be held of this fury, this rage, this madnes; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the feare of paynes to be impoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death; nothing but the apprehenſion of the paynes of hell; nothing but the horrour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17172:18"/>torments, which are ſufficient to cure their diſtemper, who thinke to immolate and ſacrifice their liues to God, when they looſe them, by putting in execution this horrible and abhominable enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>Now the ſpiritual and Eccleſiaſtical lawes, are thoſe only which can imprint in mens hartes the terrour of excommunication, and liuely apprehenſion of euerlaſting torments. For to cauſe this effect, they muſt proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eccleſiaſticall Authority; that is certaine, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, &amp; infallible, that is to ſay vniuerſall, and ſuch as conteineth nothing wherein the whole Church doth not agree. For if they proceed from doubtfull and different authority, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne ſuch thinges whereof one part of the Church houldes one opinion, the head and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes thereof teach another; thoſe, in whoſe bearts they deſire theſe thinges ſhould make impreſſion, inſteed of houlding them for certaine and infallible, and therby to be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſwayed by their threats, fall to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them, and hould them in extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion. And therefore we muſt take great heed, I ſay once againe we muſt take extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary great heed to mixe that which is in no ſort to be doubted of in this Article, and that which the whole Church agrees on (that is to ſay, that none without putting himſelfe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the diuell, and eternall death, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture vpon the life of Kinges) with any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17172:19"/>point in controuerſy, for feare of weakning that which is vndoubtedly true, by ioyning it with ſome other thing which other partes of the Church do debate, and hould in diſpute.</p>
            <p>Three points there are in the ſubſtance of your Fundamentall Law, beſides certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary pointes and circumſtances. The firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſecond point is of the temporall dignity, and ſoueraignty of the <hi>Kinges of Frances,</hi> and in this likewiſe we agree. For we beleeue our Kinges are abſolute in euery fort of temporall Soueraignty in their Realme, and that they are neither feudataries to the Pope (as ſome others who haue either receaued, or obliged their Crownes with this condition) nor to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince; but that in the pure adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of temporall thinges they depend immediatly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17172:19"/>of God, and acknowledge no other power ouer them but his. Theſe two pointes then wee hould for certaine, and vndoubted but in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of certainty: for the certainty of the firſt is diuine and theologicall; the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſecond humane and hiſtoricall. For that which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III.
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cap. per Venerab. Tit. Qui filij ſint legitimi.</note> affirmes, that the King of <hi>France</hi> acknowledgeth no ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in temporalities, is ſpoken by him in forme of hiſtorical teſtimony: and that certaine other Realmes (whereof he ſeemes to wright
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Cap. cauſam tit. eodem.</note> the ſame) haue ſince changed, and bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſome certain kind of temporall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vpon the Sea Apoſtolike; and that <hi>France</hi> remaynes in her prime eſtate, it is hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not faith that tells vs ſo.</p>
            <p>There remaynes the third point, which is this: Whether if Princes hauing made an oath to God, and their people, either themſelues or their predeceſſors, to liue and dye in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Catholick faith, and do afterwardes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their oath, rebell againſt Chriſt, bidding him open warre, that is to ſay, fall not only to open profeſſion of hereſy, or Apoſtacy from Chriſtian Religion, but withall paſſe to force their ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iectes conſciences, and goe about to plant Arianiſme, or Mahometiſme, or any ſuch like infidelity within their ſtates, and thereby deſtroy and roote out Chriſtianity; whether, I ſay, in this caſe, their ſubiects on the other ſide may not be declared abſolued
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17172:20"/>from their oath of Loyaltie and Fidelity: And this comming to paſſe to whome it appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to pronounce this abſolution.</p>
            <p>This then is the point in controuerſy betweene vs: For your article conteyneth the negariue; that is to ſay, that in no caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ſubiectes may be abſolued from the Oath of Allegiance made to their Princes. As on the contrary ſide, all other partes of the Catholike Church, togeather with this of <hi>France,</hi> ſince the inſtitution of Schooles of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, vntill the comming of <hi>Catuin,</hi> held the affirmatiue propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is, that when the Prince breakes the Oath he hath made to God and his ſubiectes to liue and dye in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion, and doth not only become an <hi>Arian,</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> but manifeſtly wars againſt Ieſus Chriſt, in compelling his ſubiects in matters of conſcience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning them to imbrace <hi>Arianiſme</hi> or <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſme,</hi> or any other deteſtable in fidelity: That then this Prince may be declared fallen from his right, as culpable of felony towardes him, to whome he hath made the oath of his Realme, that is to Chriſt: and his ſubiects may be abſolued in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, both at the ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall Tribunall, from the oath of allegiance they haue made vnto him. And that in this caſe, it belongs to the authority of the Church, reſident either in her head the <hi>Pope,</hi> or in her body a <hi>Councell,</hi> to publiſh this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17172:20"/>declaration. And not only all the other partes of the Catholike Church, but likewiſe all the Doctors who liued in <hi>France</hi> from the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of ſchooles of Diuinity amongſt them, haue held the affirmatiue opinion, that in the caſe of hereticall, or infidell Princes, and ſuch as perſecute Chriſtianity, or Catholike Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, their ſubiects may be abſolued from their oath of allegiance. By meanes wherof though the contrary doctrine were the trueſt, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the other partes of the Church being againſt it, you cannot hould it for more then problematical in matter of faith. I call that doctrine problematicall in matter of faith, which we are not bound to belieue, by neceſſity of faith, and the contradictory therof doth not binde them that belieue it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and diſunion or ſeparation from the community. Otherwiſe you muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the communion which you exerciſe with the other partes of the Church, houlding the contrary doctrine, yea euen that communion which you conſerue with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your predeceſſours, was vnlawfull, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with hereſy and excommunication.</p>
            <p>And indeed thoſe who take vpon them to defend the doctrine of the Engliſh Oath which is the patterne of yours,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VVidring. disput. de Iuram. fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 19.</note> defend it for no other then problematicall, <hi>Our intention</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is not to affirme the other opinion, as repugnant to faith, or ſaluation, it being defended and mayntei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17172:21"/>by ſo many &amp; ſo great Deuines, whome God forbid we ſhould go about to condemne of ſo great a cryme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore to include this clauſe vnder the ſame obligation of faith, vnder that very degree of excommunication, vnder the which we comprehend the condemnation of thoſe which attempt the liues of Princes, is to fall into <hi>foure manifeſt Inconueniences,</hi> which our Chamber hath giuen me in charge to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eies. <hi>The firſt,</hi> is to force mens ſoules, and intangle their conſciences, in bidding them to belieue, and ſweare vnder payne of excommunication, as doctrine of faith, and conformable to the word of God, a point of doctrine, the contrary wherof is held by all the other partes of the Catholike Church, and hath byn euer hitherunto, by their owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours. <hi>The ſecond inconuenience,</hi> is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ouerthrow the authority of the Church, and to open the gate to all ſortes of hereſies, to giue ſcope to lay men, without direction, or warrant either of generall Councell, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall ſentence, to vndertake the deciſion of matters of faith, to determine pointes of Controuerſy, and to pronounce openly what is conformable to the Scripture, what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and deteſtable. This then we ſay is to vſurpe the office of Prieſthood; this is to ſtretch our hand to the Arke; this is to take the Cenſar for Sacrifice. In briefe, this is to commit the ſelfe ſame outrages, for which Gods male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17172:21"/>haue iuſtly fallen long ſince on the vſurpers, as wel priuate perſons as Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <hi>The third Inconuenience,</hi> is to throw vs head long into euident and ineuitable ſchiſme. For all other Catholike nations houlding this doctrine, we cannot declare it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to holy Writ, nor hould it for wicked and deteſtable, but therewithal we muſt renounce the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of the head, and other partes of the Church: and therby confeſſe, that the Church for ſo many ages hath not beene the Church of God, but the Synagogue of Sathan: not the ſpouſe of Chriſt, but the Diuells ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. <hi>The fourth Inconuenience,</hi> is not only to make fruſtrate the remedy, which men ſeeke in this peril of Princes, in weakning that which is held for certaine and vndoubted, by ioyning it to a thing contradicted; but withall inſteed of aſſuring the life and eſtate of Princes, to put in great daunger both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by meanes of wars and other miſchances and diſaſters, which ordinarily ſchiſme dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes after it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>(Gentlemen)</hi> the foure pointes our Company haue giuen me in charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vnto you, which I will do my beſt to diſpatch with all poſſible cleernes and facility, if you pleaſe to heare me with the like patience you haue hitherto continued, which I eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuade my ſelfe you will, if you ſet before your eies the importance of the matter I am
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17172:22"/>heare to treate with you, which is the greateſt at this preſent in Chriſtendome. And beſides; conſider that it is not my ſelfe, whome you heare ſpeake in this Controuerſy. For it is not I who ſpeake in this cauſe, but the whole body of the Eccleſiaſticall Order, and all that of the Nobility adioyned vnto it, and which haue deputed theſe twelue Noble men, taken from the twelue Gouernementes in the Realme, of purpoſe to giue authority to my wordes with their preſence: and withall to giue teſtimony in this preſent occaſion, of the ſelfe ſame deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their predeceſſours haue euer borne the Church, which they haue planted by their Armes, and watered with their bloud, in the furtheſt partes of the world. And therfore I will no more enlarge my ſelfe in begging of you, fauourable audience and attention; only let me intreate you, before I enter into the matter, to giue me leaue to make theſe two proteſtations, therby to preuent certaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations. The firſt, that when I ſay, thoſe who hould the negatiue part, cannot hould it for other then <hi>Problematicall,</hi> I intend not to comprehend by the word <hi>Problematicall,</hi> that which concernes the condemnation of thoſe parricides, who vndertake to kill Princes: for this I hould for a point of faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the contrary opinion for hereticall, and guilty of all ſortes of excommunication and eternall puniſhment. The other, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17172:22"/>to my diſpoſition, and full ſore againſt my will, that I come to treate of theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in ſuch a time, when our Country is newly come out of many differences, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in State-matters, and is yet full of debates in matters of Religion; and haue refuſed this charge many times, euen with teares, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well how I was to imbarke my ſelfe in a ſea full of rockes and perills, and to how many harſh contradictions and calumniations I ſhould expoſe my ſelfe. But the publiſhing of Copyes of your Article (the bruit wherof was ſpred farre and neere) hath hindered vs from keeping it any longer ſecret; and the wound once diſcouered, the diſcharge of our Office bound vs to ſeeke a remedy.</p>
            <p>NOvv then Gentlemen <hi>(concerning the firſt Inconuenience)</hi> to lay the foundation of my diſcourſe, not on pillars of gold, as <hi>Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſaid, but on the firme pillars of Hiſtory, and practiſe of the Church, the methode I will obſerue, ſhalbe in prouing two things. The one, that not only all the other parts of the Church which are at this day in the world hould the affirmatiue opinion, that is to ſay, in the caſe of hereticall Apoſtataes, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Princes, the ſubiects may be abſolued from their Oath of allegiance made to them or their predeceſſours: but alſo for theſe eleuen hundred yeares, there hath not been any one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17172:23"/>age, in which this doctrine hath not byn belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and practiſed in diuers nations. The other, that it hath byn continually held in <hi>France,</hi> where our Kings, and particulerly thoſe of the laſt race, haue defended it by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and armes; where our Councells haue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and mayntained it; where our Biſhops, and Scholaſticall Doctours, ſince the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſchooles of Diuinity vntill our dayes, haue written, preached, and taught it; and where, to conclude, all our Magiſtrates, Officers and Lawyers haue followed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Wherewith notwithſtanding I intend not to help my ſelfe, but where they ſerue to defend either the generall <hi>Theſes,</hi> that is to ſay, Whether in ſome caſes the ſubiects may be abſolued from the Oath made by them to their Princes; or this particuler <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that in the caſe of hereticall Apoſtataes, and perſecuting Princes, their Subiects may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed withall in obeying them. To the end therfore to free you from all obſcurity, I will not oppugne your Article, but by thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes wherin our Doctours of <hi>France,</hi> who haue written in defence of Princes temporall authority, do all agree; conteyning my ſelfe notwithſtanding in the ſimple playne way of fact, without paſſing to that of right, the deciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof appertaines not to this tyme nor place.</p>

But if he be worthy of depoſition for a cryme ciuill and politique, it then belongeth not to the Pope to depoſe him. And it is not to be ſaid, that the condition of the Emperour, and of other Kinges, is not paralell, alike, and equall.

            <p>To the ſecond inſtance, which is of the complaint of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. the defendors of the exception make the very ſame anſwere: That the ſource and origen of that difference was not matter of religion, but caſes meerely temporall, that is, of the league and aſſociation that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> and King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. at that time Duke of <hi>Millane,</hi> had made and entred into againſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For the Pope ſeeing how the King grew as great as he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in <hi>Italy,</hi> fel of from that alliance with him, and reconciled himſelfe with the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The King incenſed with this ſeparation, and the Popes deportement, and bad carriage towardes him thereon following, cauſed a Councell to be held at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and after againe at <hi>Millan,</hi> by the Cardinals and other Prelates of his ſide, where the Pope was declared ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the adminiſtration of the vniuerſal Church. The Pope ſore moued at this attaint, cauſed another to be held at <hi>Rome,</hi> where to requite the King, he declared him, and his adherents depoſed from the adminiſtration of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17172:41"/>their temporall Eſtates. But the <hi>French</hi> both Eccleſiaſtike and Laike, knowing that the firſt ſource &amp; beginning of that diſcord proceded from paſſion of matter of State, &amp; not of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, interteyned vnion in ſuch ſort with the King, as nothing could ſeparate them from him. For as touching the loſſe that happened vnto <hi>Iohn de Albret</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> the Continuer of <hi>Paulus Aemiltus,</hi> though he was a ſore enemy of the memory of Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> confeſſeth not, that the ſentence of the Pope was the true cauſe: on the contrary, he maynteineth that the cauſe for which <hi>Iohn de Albret</hi> loſt the Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> was for breaking of from the alliance he had with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> which alliance <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> affirmed was ratified vpon condition, that if the Kinges of <hi>Nauarre</hi> did violate the ſame, then the Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhould returne to the Spaniardes: and he did put himſelfe into that alliance of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12. vnder promiſe, that he ſhould procure the ſoueraignity of <hi>Berne</hi> to be reſtored vnto him. This then the Continuer of <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> auerreth to be the true cauſe of the loſſe of the Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> And the other neither to haue beene the true cauſe, nor true pretext, but only a help of a pretext, of which <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> not hauing taken his aduantage, did not yet leaue to pretend, that the Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> appertained vnto him, and ſo to take

               <hi>I am ſorie, that I haue held, that the Pope was Monarch ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and can depoſe Princes that are rebellious to his commaundements.</hi> And therefore to what purpoſe is it to alleadge this hiſtory, and other the like, which ſpeake of temporall Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, alleadging them againſt the exception of which we treate, which they who make it, extend but to the caſes of Hereſy, or of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity alone, that is to ſay, of abiuration of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, or Chriſtian Religion? But it may be replied, that the Popes may well impute vnto Kinges, either by paſſion or bad information, that they be Heretikes or Apoſtata's from Chriſtian Religion, though they be not ſo indeed. But againſt this, the authors of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thinke they haue carefully prouided. For firſt they proteſt, that they meane to ſpeake of an Hereſy notorious, well knowne, and condemned by the precedent ſentence of the Church. And ſecondly they confeſſe not, that the execution temporall of theſe Eccleſiaſticall iudgmentes (that is to ſay of actuall depoſition) appertaineth to the Pope, but to the body of the Realme. By occaſion wherof, if the Pope erre in fact, and he preſuppoſe falſely, that a Prince maketh a publique profeſſion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, or eſtabliſh an Hereſy condemned by the Church (a matter that cannot be concealed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17172:43"/>or hidden) the Cleargy and all the reſt of the Realme in place of following the iudgment of the Pope, do ioyne themſelues with the King; and make knowne vnto the Pope, how he was deceaued, and miſtaken in the fact, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the matter may be iudged in full Councell, the Church of <hi>France</hi> being preſent.</p>
            <p>In ſo much as it is ſo far off that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceding reſtrayned to the only caſe of Hereſy or manifeſt Apoſtacy from Chriſtian Religion, may cauſe the ruine and ouerthrow of Catholike Kinges, as that on the contrary it doth aſſure and fortify them with a double rampaire. For if the ſubiects haue any bad will, they are not permitted vnder pretext of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to moue any thing againſt their Prince, vntill the authority of the vniuerſall Church, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either in the head which is the Pope, or in the body which is the Councell, hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him fallen into hereſy, or Apoſtacy from Chriſtian Religion. And if the Pope deceaued or miſinformed in the fact, precipitantly and vniuſtly declare him ſuch a one; beſides the recourſe that the <hi>French</hi> are wont to haue to require of the Pope, that the matter may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a Councell, where the Biſhops of all the Church, &amp; in particuler thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Church are preſent; the declaration of the Pope cannot be followed to the temporall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is actuall depoſition, vntill the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme conſent vnto it, and ſee demonſtratiuely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17172:43"/>by the conuerſation of their Prince, whether he maketh profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Catholike Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of any other. Now, who vnderſtandeth not, that it much more profiteth Kings to haue this double rampaire before them, that is, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be deſigned againſt them, without the preuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Churches vniuerſall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor be effected without the concurrence of the conſent of their people, then to permit &amp; leaue to the liberty of euery particuler perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to cenſure of the religion of his Prince, &amp; after he hath giuen his iudgment, to make himſelfe an arbitrer of the remedy that is to be applied?</p>
            <p>It further appeareth, that our Kinges haue beene ſo farre of from thinking that this barre of the Popes authority, interpoſed betweene them and their ſubiects, hath beene preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto them, as on the contrary they haue with great inſtance obteyned of the Popes (and that by a priuilege both very ſingular and fauourable) that none other but the Popes may excommunicate the Kinges of <hi>France,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe interdiction, be it in generall vpon the whole Realme, or in particuler vpon the Landes vnder their obedience.</p>

            <p>But me thinkes I heare You already ſay, that the matter of this article is not a queſtion of Religion, but a ſimple and meere queſtion of Eſtate, and Policy. As if to handle, how farre the ſpirituall vſe of the keyes, and of the power of binding and looſing, which God hath giuen vnto his Church, extendeth it ſelf, were not a queſtion of Religion? As if to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether theſe keyes might paſſe to the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of them, that willingly obey their Princes, who after hauing done homage of their Crownes to Ieſus Chriſt, come to vſe manifeſt felony againſt him, to proclay me warre againſt him, and to impugne his faith and doctrine, were not a queſtion of Religion? As though to diſpute whether thoſe keys could in conſcience, and in the Churches tribunall abſolue ſoules of the Oath of Allegiance, they owe to their Princes, when their Princes violate, and breake the reciprocall Oath they haue made to God and to them, to mayntaine them in Chriſtian and Catholike Religion, were not a queſtion of Religion?</p>
            <p>For therin being two obligations and bandes, by which the ſubiectes are bound to obey their Princes, the one <hi>politicke,</hi> which hath for his ſcope, the peace and felicity of the temporall life, and againſt the violating

And more then this, whatſoeuer the matter be in it ſelfe, who ſeeth not, that to diſpute, if it be conforme, or contrary to Gods word, is a queſtion of Religion?</p>
            <p>But ſome will reply, and ſay, that this is ſo cleere and ſo euident by Scripture, as it admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neither vntruth, nor diſpute, nor cenſure. Is it true? Where then there is a propoſition which all the ſchoole Doctours, and namely the two great lightes of Schoole Diuinity S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and S. <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and ſo many other Biſhops and Doctours, haue thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17172:50"/>or at leaſt not repugnant to the word of God; ſhall the contrary propoſition be ſo cleere in Scripture, as it ſhall need neither to be diſputed about, nor cenſured? And what article then of faith may not be thruſt out of the Churches Tribunall, and expoſed to the prey of Hereticall preſumption, if it be inough to ſay, that it is ſo cleere in Scripture, as that therin, there is neither need of diſpute, nor iudgment?</p>
            <p>Indeed this might haue ſome apparence, if thoſe who hold the one of the propoſitions, ſhould alledge Scriptures for themſelues, and the others ſhould not cite any at all. But as well thoſe who hold the affirmatiue propoſition, as thoſe who hold the negatiue, argue by Scripture, anſwere by Scripture, and reply by Scripture.

            <p>Thoſe contrariwiſe who ſtand for the negatiue part, anſwere, that the organs, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, miniſters, and oracles of ſuch depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were the Prophets, who were particulerly and infallibly inſtructed, taught and inſpired of Gods will, and that their actions cannot be drawne into a conſequence for the time of the Euangelicall law, wherin there be more Prophets.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who reply forthe affirmatiue part ſay, that where there were in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> religion, two ſortes of miſſions, the one ordinary which was Sacerdotall, and the other extraordinary which was that of the Prophets it; was to this end, that if the ordinary came to decay, or to decline, it might be rayſed vp agayne and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the extraordinary: But in the law of the Ghoſpell there is but one miſſion, and that Sacerdotall, or of Prieſtes. All the authority &amp; infallibility which was in the two miſſions of the old Teſtament, is vnited in the only ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary &amp; Sacerdotall miſſion of the new; which conſequently can no more fayle, and be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in iudging of Hereſy, or of Apoſtacy from Chriſtian Religion (which be the two only cauſes, for which the French Doctours, who haue written in fauour of Kinges, think a Prince may be excluded from the right of raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer Gods people) then the propheticall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17172:51"/>miſſion of the old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And others adde, that euen in the old Teſtament this prerogatiue was not reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Prophets alone, but was extended to the Prieſt: For the Prieſts iudged of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy, <hi>If thou perceaueſt</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>that there is difficulty betwene leproſy and leproſy,</hi>

               <hi>thou ſhalt ariſe, &amp; go vp to the Prieſts of the Leuiticall ſtock.</hi> And hereof there were two reaſons: the one, for that the leproſy, as all the ancient Fathers haue obſerued, was a figure of hereſie, the iudgment wherof by right apperteyned to the Prieſts of the new law of the Goſpel alone: the other, for that the leproſy was not then one ſimple malady or diſeaſe, naturall amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is now, but it was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extraordinary,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 14.</note> miraculous and diuine. For this cauſe it lay one while in a ſtone of the wall,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 13.</note> which was to be pulled out, to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, another while in a linnen, or wollen garment.</p>
            <p>By occaſion whereof the iudgment of this plague, apperteyned to them who were the ordinary interpreters of the cauſes of Gods Ire, that is to ſay, to the Prieſtes. And in this eaſe, ſay they, all were ſubiect vnto them, euen the Kinges themſelues and bound after they had giuen ſentence of the leproſy, and declared them to be touched with it, to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from company, and from the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people. And of this they bring for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17172:51"/>example the ſtory of King <hi>Ozias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 26.</note> who was ſuddainly ſtroken with a mark in the forehead for hauing (notwithſtanding what <hi>Azarias</hi> the high Prieſt ſaid vnto him) taken the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar in hand, to offer incenſe before the Altar; &amp; the high Prieſt iudging it to be the leproſy, did thruſt him out of the Temple, and from conuerſing with the people, &amp; by that meanes cauſed, that the adminiſtration and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdome was taken from him, and transferred to his ſonne: though among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations the leproſy depriued none of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with others; nor of the gouernment of the Common wealth; witneſſe wherof is <hi>Naaman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.</note> who was Generall of the warfarre of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and Gouernour of his whole Kimgdome.</p>

<note place="margin">1. <hi>Mach.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
               </note> they allege the ſtory of <hi>Matathias</hi> high Prieſt, &amp; the head of the family &amp; houſe of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Antiochus</hi> who raigned in <hi>Iury,</hi> to haue an intent to force the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their ancient cuſtomes, and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their law, and to perſecute them by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes, torments, &amp; death, tooke armes, &amp; gathered Gods diſperſed ſeruantes together who effected &amp; wrought ſo much vnder his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17172:52"/>which without ſuch a reſolution, fauoured by Gods viſible aſſiſtance, had els beene quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated, and aboliſhed out of the land.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who hold the negatiue part, come downe to the new Teſtament, and cite for themſelues this paſſage of <hi>S.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> where he writeth; <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>For he that reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the order inſtituted of God.</hi> And this of S. <hi>Peter: Be ye ſubiect, whether it be to Kings, as more excelling, or to Rulers.</hi> And by this they inferre, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Kinges, is of <hi>Right Diuine,</hi> and therefore cannot admit diſpenſation by any authority, neither ſpirituall nor temporall.</p>
            <p>The maynteyners of the affirmatiue part, anſwere to this, that theſe paſſages do not in any ſort touch the knot, or difficulty of the controuerſie. For the queſtion (ſay they) is not, whether it be <hi>de Iure diuino,</hi> to obey Kinges whileſt they are Kinges, or knowne for Kinges; But the queſtion is, if it be <hi>de Iure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino,</hi> that he who hath beene once known, &amp; acknowledged for King by the body of Eſtate, may ceaſe to be; that is, that he may do ſome thing, by which he commeth to looſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go his rights, &amp; to ceaſe to be acknowledged for King.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe two queſtions be farre different: For, to take an example euen of him, vnder whome <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſuffered martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it was <hi>de Iure diuino</hi> to obey <hi>Nero,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17172:52"/>he was Emperour: But it was not <hi>de Iure Diuino</hi> (ſay they) that he could not fall from his Imperiall rightes, and be depoſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an enemy of the Common wealth. It was <hi>de Iure diuino,</hi> ſo long as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was by the Community of the <hi>Iewes</hi> acknowledged for King, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould obey him in matters that were not againſt God; For he was no leſſe temporall ſoueraigne of the Iewes, then was the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> vnder whome <hi>S. Peter</hi> wrote. But after that <hi>Mattathias</hi> the high Prieſt, and the reſt of the nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who liued conforme to their owne law, had declared him a Tyrant, and a violatour of the conſciences of the people of God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more their lawful Prince; the particuler <hi>Iewes</hi> were then no longer bound to yeild him obedience.</p>
            <p>And not only the defenders of the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue parte: but euen <hi>M. Barcklay</hi> himſelfe, who is the principall propugner of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue part, vſeth this diſtinction and ſayth:

            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17172:53"/>
            <p> And els where they adde,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2.</note> what <hi>S. Peter</hi> writeth,

And yet it followeth not, that it is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> that the Prelates, no not the Pope himſelfe, cannot fall from their rights of Prelacy; nor that it is <hi>de Iure diuino</hi> to continue to obey them, after they haue loſt their right.</p>
            <p>But the defendours of the negatiue part obiect, that the Church which liued vnder the firſt <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, neuer made vſe of this right of abſoluing in the ſpirituall Court, the Chriſtians from the Oath they had made vnto them: And contrariwiſe, that the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans preached not any other thing, then obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that they yeilded to the Emperours.</p>
            <p>To this againe the maynteyners of the affirmatiue part anſwere many thinges. For firſt they ſay, that the Church not hauing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued the Chriſtians of the Oath of fidelity by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in particuler were bound, euen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to obey them, and pray to God for the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17172:53"/>ſafety and proſperity of their Empire. And as touching the cauſe for which the Church did not take away the ſpirituall obligation, the Chriſtians had to obey them, they bring three reaſons.</p>
            <p>The firſt is; For that it had beene ouer great imprudency and folly, to irritate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, by ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a time when they were the Lordes of the whole world, &amp; for that ſuch an act could haue beene not only vnprofitable, but alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly domageable &amp; pernicious to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, againſt whom to incenſe the Emperour at ſuch time, as they had all the forces, and the world within their handes, was not to ſuccour or promote religion, but to precipitate &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it cleane. For it is not ſufficient to ſay, that the Church is bound to doe ſome thing, becauſe ſhe may lawfully do it, vnleſſe ſhe alſo can doe it with prudence and profit.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is; For that there is great difference betweene the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, vnder whome the Church began to lay her firſt foundations, and to take the firſt roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and the Princes who ſhould now fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hereſy, or into Apoſtacy from Chriſtian religion, and ſhould become either <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> or <hi>Pagans.</hi> For the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours who then were, had not yet at that tyme done homage to <hi>Christ,</hi> nor yielded or bowed their necks to Chriſtes yoke, as we read that

            <p>By meanes whereof, they not hauing beeue declared vaſſalls &amp; tributaries of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor hauing made to him any oath of homage &amp; fidelity, nor hauing beene receaued by their ſubiects with that condition they ſhould liue vnder the Empire and Enſigne of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not beeing bound to their ſubiects by contract and mutuall oath; when they began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme warre againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they fell not by their owne proper Profeſſion into any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cryme of felony; neither declared they themſelues by their owne iudgment vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and to haue loſt the Fee which they held of him; they violated not the reciprocall and mutual oath, that was betweene them &amp; their people.</p>
            <p>But at this day the Chriſtian Princes, who haue for ſo many ages ſince made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be vaſſals and tributaries of Chriſtes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17172:54"/>Kingdome, and to ſubiect their Scepters, their Diadems, &amp; Crownes vnto his Empire, who haue rayſed, ſeated, and placed his Croſſe vpon their Enſignes, and in their ſtandardes, carried it vpon the forefront of their Diadems, haue ſet it vpon the top of their Crownes, haue ſtamped it vpon their monies and coynes, that it might appeare whoſe tribute-coyne it was, haue made theſe Inſcriptions, <hi>Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat,</hi> haue bound themſelues after ſo long a tyme, by oath, at their Conſecrations, both to God and to their people, to maynteyne the faith of Chriſt, and with that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition receaued the Scepter at the handes of their Peeres, and the reciprocall oath of the people: Theſe I ſay, when they come to proclaime warre againſt Chriſt, &amp; to breake the oath they haue made to him, and to their Eſtates, not by a ſimple act of contrariety, nor by a ſimple declaration and fact of repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but by a profeſſion and proteſtation of a will alwaies bent to contradict, and to oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: not by a ſimple violating and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an oath, but by a vow and oath of a mind, reſolued for euer to violate and break their oath: not by ſimple default of faith, but by the yealding of their faith and promiſe to the enemy of him, to whome they had by a former promiſe and faith bound themſelues; that is to ſay, by abiuring and perſecuting the Catholike Religion, and by publike profeſſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17172:55"/>of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> or of <hi>Mahometaniſme,</hi> or of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme;</hi> Then they fall into a contumacy of perfidiouſnes againſt God, and make themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues incapable of the tenures they hold of their Soueraigne, &amp; vnworthy to be acknowledged for Lieutenantes of their Subiectes, and of thoſe that be vnder their charge.</p>
            <p>And from this derogateth not that which others object, that Kinges ceaſe not to be Kinges before their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; therfore the oathes which they take at their Conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not eſſentiall conditions of their Royalty: For they anſwer, that Kinges before they be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, be preſumed to haue taken their Oath, &amp; made it to their people in the perſon of their predeceſſors, as the people are alſo reputed, &amp; held to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Oathes of Allegiance vnto their Kinges, in that which they haue made to their predeceſſours.

            <p>The ſecond difference that is betweene the one &amp; the other Princes, is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers condition of Chriſtian people. For in the time of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Pagan Emperours, which is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17172:56"/>the tyme (ſayth S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) meant by the firſt part of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. epiſt.</hi> 60.</note> the Chriſtian had not yet attayned the temporall Tribunall of Chriſt, nor as yet apperteyned they to Chriſts temporall Kingdome. For as much, as Chriſt did not at that tyme exerciſe, or manage any temporall Kingdome on earth, neither had as yet any temporall Miniſters of his Lawes, but only exerciſed a ſpirituall Kingdome by his ſpirituall Miniſters, which were the Biſhops and Paſtours. But after that the ſecond part of the Prophecy was fulfilled, that is to ſay, after the conuerſion of Kings, and Countries to the Chriſtian Religion, and that Kings ſerued our Lord in feare, and apprehended diſcipline, or according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text, <hi>did homage to the Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.</note> he then gayned, and added the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not only to his ſpirituall Kingdome, which he exerciſeth by his ſpirituall Miniſters, which be the Biſhops and Paſtors; but alſo to his temporall Kingdome, which he exerciſeth by his temporall Miniſters and Subſtitutes, which be the Kings and Princes, <hi>who ſerue him</hi> (ſayth <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) <hi>not ſimply, as men in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Laws, but as Princes, in cauſing them to be obſerued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore ſince the time, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people hath, by the conuerſion of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Empires, and by the reduction of Kinges and Kingdomes, beene gayned and conſecrated to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> his temporal raigne,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17172:56"/>it cannot any more be vſurped, nor poſſeſſed by way of right, by the enemies of Chriſts name. And hence it is, that whatſoeuer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the Turke maketh of the Chriſtians, and whatſoeuer poſſeſſion of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it be, he cannot by any tract of tyme gaine the leaſt inch of preſcription ouer Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, who were formerly ſubiect to Chriſtes temporall tribunall, before any ſuch Conqueſt by him made.</p>
            <p>And to ſay the contrary, were not only to imbrace and hod one of <hi>Luthers</hi> errours, who hath taught that the warre, that the Chriſtians made againſt the Turkes, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt and vnlawful, &amp; not only to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the authority of ſo many Councells, which haue decreed the expeditions of the holy Land, for the ayding of the Chriſtians of the Eaſt, for the deliuering of them from the yoke and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of the Infidells (which had beene a thing vniuſt (For the Acceſſary followeth the Principall) and if the Chriſtians of the Eaſt had beene lawfull ſubiectes to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes, they neither could haue reuolted from them, nor rebelled againſt them:) But alſo euen to anathematize, and accurſe the memory of ſo many Chriſtian Worthies, and to affirme that ſo many Knightes, Princes and Kinges &amp; among them our moſt glorious <hi>S. Lewis,</hi> who dying in that warre, as Champious &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyners of Chriſtes cauſe, pretended to gayne
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17172:57"/>the Crowne of Martyrdome, dyed in a cauſe vniuſt and worthie of damnation.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who defend the negatiue part reply, and ſay, that in tyme of the firſt <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> before whome the Empire had already acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Chriſt Ieſus, the Church vſed not ſuch manner of proceeding, nor acquited the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of their obedience. On the contrary that the Biſhop <hi>Hoſius,</hi> writing vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apud A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thana. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, deſolit. vit. agen.</note> ſaith vnto him in theſe wordes: <hi>As he who would ſpoyle you in your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſhould reſiſt Gods ordenance: So I feare that your vſurping the authority of the Church, will make you culpable of a great cryme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this then the defendants of the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue part anſwere two thinges; The one, that the Cuſtome of obliging Princes to make an expreſſe oath vnto God, and to their people, to liue and to die in the Chriſtian and Catholique Religion, had not yet place in the tymes of the firſt Heretique, or Apoſtata Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, &amp; was not brought in but afterwards, namely then when they would ſtay, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Religion from falling into the ſame perills, wherin it was vnder them. The other, that the Church vſed not this proceeding, not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Right, but for want of force and ſtrength; not for want of power in it to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne it, but through want of ability in the Chriſtian people to execute it. For it is not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17172:57"/>inough to bind the Church to declare Princes Infidells, &amp; to haue loſt their rightes, &amp; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort their ſubiects to depart from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhe may lawfully do it, but it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, that ſhe be able to do it prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitably.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>S.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Thomas</hi> after he had ſaid: <hi>Infidells by the deſert of their Infidelity be worthy to looſe their power ouer the faithfull,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; <hi>But this the Church ſometimes doth, and ſometimes doth it not.</hi> And if we ſhould conclude that becauſe the ancient Church hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the firſt <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours excluded from the right they had from God, of commaunding Catholiks, that therefore ſhe had not the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do it; we then ſhould conclude the very ſame, that becauſe it excommunicated them not, it had no authority to do it. For we find not, that any either Pope or Councell did euer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely and perſonally excommunicate the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours: Not for that the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate them, as wel as other <hi>Aria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> whome it exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated from tyme to tyme, but for that it deemed it a matter of imprudency, and pernicious to Religion, to exaſperate them, not hauing forces to repreſſe and curbe them.</p>
            <p>And as touching <hi>Hoſius</hi> they a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere, that he ſaith, not, that the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abſolue in the ſpiritual Court, the Catholiks from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantius,</hi> if ſhe ſhould haue thought it profitable, poſſible, and neceſſary for them to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17172:58"/>attempt the deliuery of themſelues from his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Neither, ſaith he, that if the Emperour <hi>Conſtance</hi> being a Catholique Prince had not beene dead, and that he had declared and proclaymed warre againſt his brother <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> as he threatned he would do, if he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to perſecute the Catholikes; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of the Eaſt would not haue ioyned &amp; taken part with him, and would not haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued that the Church could haue diſpenſed with them about their oath of fidelity they had made to <hi>Conſtantius.</hi>

<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">

            <p>And to this againe, they who maynteyne the affirmatiue part, want not their anſwere. For on the contrary, they auerre that the Church could not do it prudently, nor profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably: For beſides, that the Chriſtians were ſo deuided, as the faction of the <hi>Arians</hi> alone, ioyned with the Heathens, (without ſpeaking of other Heretikes, or of the cold Catholikes, who as <hi>S.

               <hi>ſerued the tyme, and had not</hi> (as he further addeth) <hi>other law, then the Emperours will</hi>) held their foote vpon the Catholike Churches throate. And beſides when <hi>Iulian</hi> was Emperour, he was ſo far from perſecuting the Catholikes at the firſt, as that in the beginning of his Empire which continued but there yeares, he called the Catholike Biſhops home againe, who had beene baniſhed and ſent into exile, by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his predeceſſour. And in the end he had by fauours and his other carriage ſo gayned the ſouldiers of the Roman bands, as they made almoſt all profeſſion of Paganiſme.</p>
            <p>Whence it was, that <hi>Iouian</hi> a Chriſtian
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17172:59"/>ſouldier being by them choſen after <hi>Iulian</hi> his death, anſwered them that he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund men who were not Chriſtians. For the anſwere which they made, <hi>We are Chriſtians,</hi> was as much to ſay, that all they made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of Paganiſme to pleaſe <hi>Iulian,</hi> yet in their heartes they continued ſtill Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. By occaſion whereof the feare of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine hauing hindered the Church, from abſoluing the Catholikes from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fidelity, in behalfe of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata, they were ſtill bound to do that which <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, the Chriſtians might well haue depoſed the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for as much as they were the ſtronger in <hi>Millane,</hi> when he would haue one of their Churches, for the exerciſing of his Hereſy therin. It is true. But to this the defendants of the affirmatiue part, anſwere foure thinges. The firſt, that the memory of the Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> his elder Brother, and as it were Father and Tutor of the Emperour <hi>Valen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar,</hi> and ſlayne by <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant, and the moſt Catholike Prince, and the greateſt freind of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> that euer was, changed all the malice or euill, that the Catholike people could haue had, or carried towardes <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> into fauour and compaſſion, and into a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17172:59"/>deſire of aſſiſting him, for the reuenging of that murther, and making away of his Brother.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was yet ſo yong, &amp; the ſonne of ſo Catholike a Father, as there was not any cauſe or ground to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of his conuerſion, which alſo followed within a while after, and that with ſo great an Edification of the Church, as <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth him for one of the moſt Religious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of his age.</p>
            <p>The third, that though in the beginning the people conteyned themſelues within the ſimple boundes of petition, &amp; gaue <hi>Valentinian</hi> to vnderſtand: <hi>We contend not, O Emperour, but we become Suppliantes vnto you:</hi> yet when <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> had a meaning to proceed further, the people held their owne, reſiſted the Emperour, and ſtood ſo reſolute in the matter, as he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a tumult and reuolt, was conſtreyned to yeild vnto them. Hence it is, that they thought not, that the commandment our Sauiour gaue to his diſciples, when they perſecute in one Cittie, to flie into another, was an abſolute &amp; perpetuall precept, but rather a diſpenſation &amp; a permiſſion, accommodated to the tyme; wherein the Chriſtian people either were ſtill vnder Pagan Emperours, or had not yet the meanes to make reſiſtance, againſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by might and force.</p>
            <p>The Fourth is, that the Emperour <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> his owne ſouldiers, thought not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17172:60"/>ſo bound in way of fidelity vnto him, as they belieued they could not be diſpenſed with; when he ſhould perſeoute the Catholikes. For when the tumult began to be hoat, they cauſed it to be ſignified vnto him, that if he would come vpon the Place, he ſhould come thither accompanied, for as much as they would aſſiſt and help him, if they ſawe him conioyned, and to take part with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, els they would put themſelues in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the troupes that held with <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the propugners of the negatiue, part, recurre to the Analogy of other practiſes of the Church, &amp; ſay, that for Hereſie the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not depriued of their goodes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently much leſſe Princes ſhould be ſpoyled of their eſtates.</p>
            <p>To this agayne the maynteyners of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue part bring two anſwers. The one is, that in this our Realme, Heretikes looſe not their goodes, and the cauſe is, for that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the lawes made againſt Heretikes, is ſuſpended for the conſeruation of the publique peace, and tranquillity. But if there ſhould creep forth ſome third ſect in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; ſhould begin to growe, and were not come to be ſo great, and to make a notable part of the body of Eſtate, as <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> or <hi>Nestorieniſme</hi> it is queſtionles, that the other two would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udge them, who ſhould make ſuch profeſſion, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be depriued, not only of their goodes,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17172:60"/>but of their liues alſo. For this is practiſed at <hi>Geneua,</hi> where <hi>Caluin</hi> cauſed <hi>Seruetus</hi> to be burnt: and it is the practiſe at this day in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where the Moſt Renowned moderne King of Great <hi>Britany</hi> puniſheth the <hi>Arians,</hi> with loſſe of goodes, and of life.</p>
            <p>The other anſwere is, that there is a great difference between the power that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners haue ouer their goodes, and that which Princes haue ouer their Eſtates: For goodes are made for their Maiſters, and Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe for their Eſtates; neyther haue goods any ſoule, nor can be compelled by force, or by example, or by perſwaſion of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to looſe life euerlaſting, as ſubiectes may be by their Princes, by meanes whereof the preiudice of the one doth not make any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the other.</p>
            <p>And if this queſtion be no where found certainly decided, neither by ſcripture, nor by the decrees of the ancient Church, nor by the Analogy of other Eccleſiaſticall proceedinges, how is it, that lay perſons will of their owne authority, and without light and preſident of any generall Councell, of any Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Synod, of any vniuerſall Aſſembly of the Church, yea againſt the greater part of the reſt of the Church, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert this doctrine into an article of faith, and make the <hi>Clergie</hi> to ſweare it is conformable to Gods word, &amp; cauſe them to abiure the other, as a doctrine contrary to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17172:61"/>the word of God, impious and deteſtable?</p>
            <p>It is fiue and twenty yeares ſince thoſe of your Order, caried away by the tumult and trouble of the tyme, laboured in the full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of Eſtates, to eſtabliſh one <hi>Fundamentall Law</hi> of Eſtate, cleane contrary to that article of yours: And now you propoſe another <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Law, intituled of Eſtate, and of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> quite contrary to that former. And will you (not you, but thoſe, by whoſe inſpiration and aduiſe theſe clauſes be crept into your Bill) that the Laytie cauſe the <hi>Clergie</hi> to ſweare it? That the Laytie exact of the Clergie an Oath in matter of faith? That the Laytie impoſe the Lawes of Religion vpon the men of the Church?</p>
            <p>O reproach, and ſhame! Oſcand all! O gate ſet open to all ſort of Hereſies! And ſhall our faith then be ſubiect to the varieties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the affections of the people, who chaung euery fiue and twenty yeares?

And ſhall it be in vayne that <hi>Ozias</hi> was ſtroken with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy becauſe he would take the Cenſar in his hand? But the tyme preſſeth me to get out of this point, &amp; to diſpatch the other two remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with as much breuity as poſſibly I can.</p>
            <p>THE THIRD INCONVENIENCE, that I haue vndertaken to diſcouer and lay open to the eye, in the examen of your article was, that it did thruſt vs into a manifeſt and ineuitable ſchiſme. For to ſay nothing of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that his <hi>Holines</hi> hath already made of the Oath of <hi>England,</hi> vpon the modell wherof this Article hath been formed, and not to permit any hold to thoſe who ſay, that it ſhould be the Pope, who ſhould be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Schiſme and not we: I ſay that though the Pope intermeddle not himſelfe in our affaires, the Schiſme is all made the very houre that we accept and ſweare this Article or Bill. And that it is not the Pope, but we that make it.</p>
            <p>And to confirme it, how can we ſweare that the Pope, and all the other parts of the Catholike Church, hold a doctrine contrary to the word of God, impious and deteſtable,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17172:62"/>without making ſchiſme, and ſchiſme not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Popes perſon, but alſo againſt the Sea Apoſtolike, and againſt all the reſt of the body of the Church? For if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Communion Eccleſiaſtique, be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in faith, and in matters appertaining to ſaluation; how can we belieue, and ſweare that the Pope, and all the reſt of the Church, erre in faith, and in matters belonging to ſaluation, and hold a doctrine contrary to Gods word and impious and deteſtable, and conſequently Hereticall, without ſeparating our ſelues from Communion with them, and ſubiecting them in as much, as is in vs, to a malediction and an <hi>Anathema;</hi> and conſequently to deuide the Church, or rather ſeparate our ſelues from the Church?</p>
            <p>And how odious a thing, ſchiſme is to God, and how much it is deteſted both of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and men, we need not any more expreſſe teſtimony, then that of holy Writ, that teacheth vs, that the earth opened it ſelfe vnder the Schiſmatikes, and that they deſcended all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,

            <p>Neither doth this Article only caſt vs into an ineffable ſchiſme; but doth alſo precipitate vs into a manifeſt hereſy, neceſſarily obliging vs to confeſſe, that the Catholike Church is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and decayed on earth for many ages paſt. For if they, who imbrace the oppoſite Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hold an opinion cotrary to Gods word, impious and deteſtable; the Pope hath not then for ſo many ages paſt, beene Head of the Church and Chriſtes vicar, but an Heretike &amp; Antichriſt, and all the other partes of the Church, haue not beene true partes of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17172:63"/>Church, but members of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>And this being ſo, where continued the Catholike Church? In <hi>France</hi> alone? And ſhall then the Part haue giuen a bill of diuorce to the whole? Shall then that which an ancient Father cried out be accompliſhed: <hi>I ſee that, which cannot be done;</hi>

            <p>And this done, where ſhould the Church haue beene? In the deſert of the Apocalyps? And why then ſhould we with ſo mayne force
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17172:63"/>oppugne the inuiſibilitie of the Heretikes Church? Wherefore ſhould we delay to yeald them the victorie, and our armes, and all? For what greater trophies and ſignes of victory can we rayſe and ſet vp for them, then to auerre &amp; profeſſe, that the viſible Kingdome of Chriſt, ſhould be periſhed &amp; cleane decayed through the world: and that for ſo many hundred yeares paſt, there hath beene neither temple of God, nor ſpouſe of Chriſt, nor Church, but that all hath beene the Kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the Synagoue of Sathan, and the ſpouſe of the Diuell? And what ſtronger machines &amp; engines, could they deſire for the aboliſhing &amp; ouerthrowing of the Article of <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that of <hi>Auricular Confeſsion,</hi> and other the like, which were decided againſt the <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in few wordes for the ouerturning and ruining of all Catholike Religion, then to ſay, that the Church which hath decided them, hath done it without authority, and was not at that tyme any more Chriſtes Church, but Antichriſtes Concubine? See therefore wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto theſe men leade vs, who compell vs to ſweare, that it is a doctrine contrary to Gods word, impious and deteſtable, to hold, that ſubiects in ſome caſes may be abſolued of their fidelitie. And this propoſition they would haue vs put in the ſame concluſion of faith, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame decree of <hi>Anathema,</hi> with that of the murthering of Kinges.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:17172:64"/>
            <p> THERE remayneth the laſt <hi>Inconuenience,</hi> which I promiſed to examine, which is, that this medly doth not only make the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that they would bring to the daunger of Kinges, to be vnprofitable, but more then that to be pernicious and domageable. And now I beſeech you, Gentlemen, before I enter into the matter, to permit me to tell you, that I giue not place in affection to the ſeruice of the King to any of my Countrymen. I am a <hi>French</hi> man borne, and the ſonne of a <hi>French</hi> man, and I haue neuer but reſpected our Kinges. I haue neuer in fact of State, caſt mine eyes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others, &amp; God lending me my right wits I will neuer turne mine eyes away. I haue beene nouriſhed, brought vp, intertayned and rayſed vp vnder the winges of my Soueraigne King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, &amp; haue alwayes continued an adherent to his fortunes, whileſt he liued.</p>
            <p>After his death I followed likewiſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the deceaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, of glorious memory, and that with a good, and with a ſound conſcience, euen according to the <hi>Maximes,</hi> as well of thoſe who defend the affirmatiue part, as of thoſe who hold the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. For to ſay nothing of the word of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe,</hi> that was by bad information imputed vnto him, he was neuer either perſecutour or incorrigible. On the contrary, after the tyme of his predeceſſors death, he promiſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to informe himſelf and be inſtructed, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17172:64"/>in his greateſt affayres, he did me the honour to confer with me in ſecret about the points of our faith, for the preparing of himſelfe to his Conuerſion. I brought him by the grace of God back, or the grace rather by me to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion. I obteyned his abſolution at <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 8 and reconciled him with the Sea Apoſtolike: Actions, by which he effected and wrought the recouery of his Eſtate, and the reſtoring of you all to your houſes, commodities, and fortunes.</p>
            <p>I euer ſerued him after that, ſupporting &amp; vpholding the honour, and rightes of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, in a more affectionate manner then I tendred mine owne life; not here, where it is an eaſy matter to extoll the Kinges ſoruice, and to commend, as the ſaying is, the <hi>Athenians at Athens,</hi> but out of his owne Kingdome, and there where matters were canuaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vpon. And of this alſo, I haue receaued for a ſigne, and teſtimony of approbation of my ſeruice, all theſe honours &amp; commodities I am now poſſeſſed of; for as much as I neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued neither goods nor dignities, but of him. It is he alone who hath aduanced me, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me vp to a <hi>Biſhop, Archbiſhop,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall.</hi> He made me <hi>Great Almenour,</hi> and beſtowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me the meanes and prouiſions, neceſſary for the helping of me, towards the ſuſteyning and bearing out a part of theſe charges.</p>
            <p>And from the King his Sonne, I continue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17172:65"/>the enioyng and poſſeſſion of the ſame benefits and good turnes, without hoping or deſire of hope of gratificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from any other. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Gentlemen, you ought to be belieue that I am not moued in this, for any other intereſt, then for his ſeruice and for the conſeruation of the Catholike Religion, in preſeruation whereof is comprehended both the ſpirituall and temporall ſafety of himſelf, &amp; of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>For the firſt branch then of our laſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is, that the mixtion of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious matters, maketh the remedy which they would bring for the daunger of Kinges, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull and vnprofitable, we haue already ſaid inough from the beginning. For ſeeing we will agree both the one &amp; the other that the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall laws, &amp; the paynes &amp; penalties impoſed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the body, do not any waies ſerue the turne or be inough to preuent, auert, &amp; put by theſe wicked attemptes, and that we muſt make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſpirituall lawes, and to the paynes that be exerciſed after death, that is to ſay, to the lawes of excommunication, and of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eternall; and for that reaſon teacheth vs, that the lawes of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and of <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> make not any impreſſion in the ſoules, if they be not belieued to proceed from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibleauthority, how is it, when there ſhalbe intermixed ſome clauſe conteſtated &amp; called into queſtion, by the reſt of the Church, that they will ſerue for a bridle to thoſe, who feare
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17172:65"/>nothing but the paynes and tormentes of the ſoules? And how ſhall ſuch lawes imprint the terrour and feare of <hi>Anathema</hi> in mindes, that ſhall belieue, that the lawes themſelues be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to <hi>Anathema?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, how will they not quite ouerthrowe, the good and ſufficient remedies, that the generall Councells, whereof the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is infallible, haue inſtituted for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety of Kinges, which they would take from vs by the medly of other thinges wherevnto the vniuerſall Church doth not agree? I haue ſayd good &amp; ſufficient remedies for the ſafety of Kinges, which they would haue taken from vs; For who knoweth not, that if the infernal monſters, who made the attemptes vpon the liues of our two laſt Kinges, had read the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical lawes, they had found their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſſed in the decree of the Councell of <hi>Constance.</hi> And therefore it was not for default of Eccleſiaſticall lawes, that they committed thoſe two moſt horrible murders, but for this, that they had not read them, or rather by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of an enraged and diuelliſh malice, wherewith they were poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>But they will reply, that it was not inough for the ſecuring and aſſuring of the life of Kinges, that the Church hath decreed vnder the payne of Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, that none may attempt vpon their perſons, if it decreeth not further, vnder the ſame paynes, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17172:66"/>cannot be abſolued from their obedience, in whatſoeuer eſtate they be, that is to ſay, euen when they ſhould make profeſſion of hereſy, or incorrigible Infidelity, and ſhould become perſecutours and violators of conſcience. For though (ſay they further) the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, that no attempt be made vpon the life of Princes; yet if the Princes happen to fall into incorrigible Hereſy or Apoſtacy, and become perſecutours of the faith, and that the Church thereupon declare their ſubiectes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from the oath of Allegiance, and that notwithſtanding this declaration, they will inforce the ſubiects to continue their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto them, they become Tyrants. And then (adde they) the Politique Lawes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>euery particuler body</hi> to attempt vpon the perſon of Tyrantes, and conſequently their life in caſe of Hereſie, or of Apoſtacy cannot be ſecured.</p>
            <p>To this obiection the anſwere is ſhort and eaſy. For the Church intermedleth not her ſelfe with the abſolution of the ſubiects, but in the Ecclſiaſticall Court: and therin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this payne, and that of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it impoſeth not any other. By meanes wherof it is ſo far from conſenting, that any attempt be made vpon the life of them whom it hath excommunicated, as it abhorreth all fortes of killinges, and murtheringes, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as be ſudaine and vnexpected, in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17172:66"/>regard of the loſſe of both body and ſoule, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly go therin accompanied togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And if they ſay, that the Church orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it not, but that it is the cauſe that it is done, for as much as the Common wealth conforming it ſelfe to the Churches iudgment, and making the ſame deciſion in the tribunall politique, if the Prince keepe on his former courſe, declareth him a Tyrant, and an enemy of the ſtate, and conſequently ſubiecteth him to the power of the Lawes politique, which permit the conſpiring againſt Tyrantes, for the making of them away, and for killing of them: we bring firſt this exception, that there is great difference betweene Tyrantes of vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, whome the Lawes permit to extirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate by all manner of wayes, and Tyrantes of adminiſtration and gouernement, who are lawfully called to their Principality, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it ill: and we add that the Hereticall Princes who perſecute the faith and their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſubiects, be of the number of Tyrantes of adminiſtration, and not of the number of Tyrants of vſurpation, againſt whome alone it is permitted to conſpire by clandeſtine and ſecret practiſes.</p>
            <p>And if they further vrge and ſay, that the politique Lawes permit conſpiracies againſt the one and the other: we anſwere, that they are politique, prophane, and heatheniſh Laws,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17172:67"/>as thoſe of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> or of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> in former tymes, and not Chriſtian poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Lawes. For the Chriſtian politique Laws conſider not only in their Princes the reſpect due vnto them, for the good of temporall pollicy, and the regard of the Maieſty of the Eſtate which they repreſent, but they further conſider in them the Image and vnction of God, who hath called them to that Dignity, in ſo much as in them, who haue once had the lawfull vocation of Royalty, what Tyrany ſoeuer they exerciſe, the Chriſtian politique Laws neuer paſſe ſo farre, as to permit the vſe of proſcription againſt their perſons, or that any do attempt by clandeſtine, or ſecret coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or conſpiracy againſt their perſons, or liues; but they carry the ſame reſpect to them, that did <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he knew he were reiected,

            <p>In ſo much, as if the Chriſtians be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to defend their religion, and their life againſt Hereticall and Apoſtata Princes, from whoſe allegiance they were abſolued, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian politique Laws permit not more then what is permitted by military Lawes, and the right of nations; that is to ſay, open warre and not clandeſtine and ſecret <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17172:67"/>a certain habitude to the dignity Royall, &amp; as it were a marke of a politique character, that diſcerneth them from ſimple particulers: and when the obſtacle and impediment is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that is, when they come to amend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to giue ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it reſtoreth them to the lawfull vſe and exerciſe of their regality.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſee, that in ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies that the <hi>Popes</hi> haue had with te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall Princes, neuer any Pope went ſo far as to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or to aſſent to the murthering of Princes. Contrariwiſe if any calumniators laboured to impute it vnto them, they haue euer iuſtified themſelues, euen with the horrour and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuch actes, remembring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of theſe wordes of <hi>S.

               <hi>the Nation of the Lombards ſhould at this day haue had neither King non gouernors: But becauſe I ſtand in feare of God, I will not haue to moddle, or deale with the death of any perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And touching the other point of the laſt <hi>Inconuenience,</hi> which is, that this medly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the remedies, that they would bring to the daunger of the Kinges, to be not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but alſo pernicious and domageable, there needeth not much eloquence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it. For if thoſe who made the attempts vpon the liues of our Kinges, were moued to thoſe horrible parricides by a falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17172:68"/>which they conceaued, to wit, that our Kings did ſomething in preiudice of religion, how much more would they haue thought they had a greater &amp; better pretext, if they had beleeued, that our Kings had abuſed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by the bringing in of ſchiſme, and the ouerthrowing of Religion, and that they had ſeene themſelues in ſchiſme, &amp; ſeparated from the communion of the Sea Apoſtolique, and cut off from the other partes of the Church?</p>
            <p>And more then this, who vnderſtandeth not, that there cannot happen any thing of more and greater daunger for the life and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Kinges, then inteſtine and ciuill wars, which ſchiſmes do ordinarily draw after them?</p>
            <p>Moreouer who knoweth not, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indifferencie of Religion, which muſt needes follow vpon ſchiſmes, engendreth and occaſioneth Impiety and Atheiſme, and taketh quite away all the reſpect that men are wont to carry to Kinges for the loue of God, and for the reuerence of Religion, which is the ſtrongeſt corps or Court of Guard, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt rampaire for the defence and ſecurity of their perſons? For when Religion is had in contempt, men are not any longer withholden from attempting vpon the perſons of Kinges, then by force, and by feare of the temporall paynes, and therfore when they thinke they may do it, without beeing puniſhed, or that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17172:68"/>they contemne and make no reckoning of the temporall paynes, they haue no more bridle to conteyne them, or to hold them in.</p>
            <p>Finally, who ſeeth not, that there can be nothing worſe for the ſafety of the perſons, and of the eſtate of Kinges, then to ſtir vp, and drawe vpon them, by an ouerture of a new ſchiſme, and diuiſion from the Church,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.</note> 
               <hi>the wrath of him, who taketh away the ſpirits of Princes from out of the earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And heere, Gentlemen, I will not with you vſe more reaſons and argumentes, but wil paſſe ouer to exhortations and intreaties; and wil coniure you to remember, that you are <hi>French</hi> men, and that you are alſo Chriſtians and Catholikes, and that in treating touching the ſecuring of Kinges, you muſt not only caſt your eies vpon the earth, but alſo lift them vp to Heauen; and you muſt not remedy their temporall ſafetie in cauſing them to forgo and looſe the euerlaſting, nor prouide for your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily part which is <hi>France,</hi> by deſtroying and ruyning the ſpirituall parte, which is the Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> tolerateth and endureth for the good of the Churches peace, that the <hi>French-men,</hi> that is to ſay ſome of them hold &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne in this point, Doctrine contrary to his owne, and to that of all the reſt of the Church, ſo they hold it only as problematicall, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, that is to ſay, that they propoſe it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17172:69"/>not as neceſſary to be held, with that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is of faith, and declare not the other to be contrary to Gods word, impious and deteſtable. And though in the caſes before ſpecified, there be ten Countries againſt but a parte of one, an hundred Doctours againſt one, ten Councells againſt none: yet whether it be that theſe Councells do not therin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their intention by forme of deciſion of faith, but by forme &amp; manner of ſuppoſition, or for ſome other cauſes, he is contented to hold the Doctrine contayned in them for true, without binding vs to hold it for neceſſary, as matter of faith; he is contented to hold the contrary opinion for erroneous, without bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs to hold it for Hereticall, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them, as Heretikes, that hold it.</p>
            <p>And wherefore then ſhould wee now go about to breake the Churches communion, &amp; to deuide the vnity of Chriſtes body, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into matter of fayth, a doctrine, which doth not only make the remedies, which they would bring for the ſecurity of Kinges, vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but further, maketh them pernicious, both to their perſons, and to their Kingdome?</p>
            <p>There is no tyme wherin ſchiſmes be not moſt domageable, and preiudiciall to religion and to State, but they be moſt of all ruinous and pernicious to the one and the other, when the tymes be already infected with hereſy. For as the Phiſitians ſay, that in the tyme of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17172:69"/>all ſortes of feuers end in the plague: ſo in the tyme of Hereſy all ſchiſmes haue their ending in Hereſy. And therefore Hereſie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now at this day ſo great part in <hi>France,</hi> if we proceed to bring in a ſchiſme among Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, who doubteth but that the fruite of this diuiſion, will be the enfeebling and weakning of the Church, and the ſtrengthning of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy? And if Hereſy euen when ſhe is weakeſt hath ſo much ado to keep herſelfe quick, how will ſhe continue in peace when ſhe ſhall once come to an equality? And if we breake it, how ſhall ſhe be able to diſturbe the peace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without troubling therewithall the Kinge, and the State alſo?</p>
            <p>It is certayne, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the ſcope and intention of them that firſt moued this ſtone of ſcandall, was not to prouide for the ſecurity of the State, and the perſon of our Kinges: Their drift and intention was to caſt the ſeedes of diuiſion in the Church of <hi>France,</hi> and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay either to ſeparate it from the other partes of the Church, or to deuide it within it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſay not this to taxe you. I honour you all, as perſons of ſingular wiſedome, and merit, and moſt affected to the Catholike Religion. But I know you are not the firſt authors and inuentors of this Article. I know that it hath beene craftily thruſt into ſome of your ſeates, It is not long tyme ſince they haue menaced and threatned vs with this apple of diſcord.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17172:70"/>Theſe be thoſe that be already ſeuered from vs, and haue by this meanes thought to ſow ſome ſparcles of diuiſion amongſt vs; and for this end they haue ſerued themſelues of men, who carry the name of Catholikes, and more then that, of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining &amp; beguiling of the ingenuity, good diſpoſition, and ſimplicity of others, vnder the title of ſeruice to the King.</p>
            <p>The pretext they haue taken, is fayre, it is ſpecious, it is ouer ſhadowed with the name of the King, but vnder this couer, is hiden ſchiſme and the deſigne of making a diuiſion in the Church. Theſe be the <hi>Vliſſeſſes</hi> fighting vnder <hi>Achilles</hi> his buckler,</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata meant to draw the Chriſtians to the adoration of the falſe Gods, he cauſed the Idolls of <hi>Iupiter, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to be intermixed, and put in company with his owne pictures, to the end, that when they ſhould preſent his owne Images to the Chriſtians to adore (as it was the cuſtome then, for the people to adore the Images of their Emperour) the Chriſtians either refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to do it, ſhould be accuſed of high treaſon, as hauing refuſed to adore the Emperours Image, or in doing it be conſtreyned ioyntly with the Image of the Emperour to adore Idolls. Theſe men haue heere done the very ſame, hauing intermedled in one and the ſame Article, a decree of the ſecuring of Kinges, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17172:70"/>with an introduction of ſchiſme, to the end that thoſe who ſhal refuſe this oath, ſhould put themſelues in daunger, either to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med litle affectioned to the ſeruice of Kinges, or to be thought culpable of ſchiſme.</p>
            <p>And therefore you muſt not ſuffer your ſelues to be beguiled by this firſt bayte. It is of hony, but yet of hony, that hath beene made by drone bees, that haue gone from one flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of hemlock to another, that is to ſay, by ſoules that haue taſted and ſucked the venome of ſchiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth, that we muſt behold plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures not before, but behind, not when they are comming, but when they are gone &amp; paſt. In like manner in this there be ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textes, you muſt regard and behold them, not by the face, that is to ſay, by the firſt ſight, but by the back, that is, by the ſequele and ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>This Oath reſembleth <hi>Horace</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter, which hath the head of a fayre and beautifull woman, that is, the pretence of the ſeruice and ſafety of Kings; but it hath a fiſhes tayle, that is the tayle of Schiſme, and of diuiſion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And indeed it may well be ſaid to haue a fiſhes tayle, ſeeing it is come ſwymming by ſea from <hi>England.</hi> For it is the very ſame Oath of <hi>England</hi> (ſauing that of <hi>England</hi> is yet more ſweete, and more modeſt &amp; moderate.) I will not proſecute this point for feare to offend the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17172:71"/>moſt Renowned King of Great <hi>Britany.</hi> I am (ſetting aſide religion) his moſt humble and moſt affectionate ſeruant. I do in a moſt high degree, eſteeme, &amp; honour his learning, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent morall vertues, and his excellent natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conditions, and I find nothing to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me in him, that might expreſſe, not a fayned Image made at pleaſure, as that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> but the true and reall image of a perfect, and complete Prince, the title of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> only excepted.</p>
            <p>Hee hath bound in generall all men of learning vnto him, hauing made the <hi>Muſes</hi> to ſit in his Royall throne, and he hath obliged me in particuler, for hauing pleaſed to take the paynes, to enter with me into the liſtes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Diuinity, &amp; not to do as did <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> who diſdayned to enter into the <hi>Olympian</hi> race, if he were not to run his courſe againſt Kinges.</p>
            <p>I therefore touch not this ſtring, for feare of offending. I know that holding the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he doth, he thinketh to do what he ought, when he aſſayeth to bring in a Schiſme, and diuiſion in ours. But ſhall it be ſaid, that what the King of <hi>Great Britany</hi> doth in <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholikes, doth ſerue vs for a law, and an example to do the ſame in our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Countrey?

Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Gentlemen, ſuch will be found in <hi>France.</hi> And all we who are Biſhops will rather go to martyrdome, then giue our conſentes to the deuiding of Chriſtes body,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apud Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. Eccl. hiſt. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 37.</note> remembring this ſaying of <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>But we are not, God be thanked, vnder a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17172:72"/>King who maketh martyrs, he leaueth the ſouls of his ſubiectes free, and if he doth it to thoſe of his Subiectes, that be ſtrayed from the Church, how much more will he do it to thoſe ſoules of his Catholike ſubiects? we liue the one and the other, vnder the ſhadow of the Edictes of peace, in liberty of conſcience. And wherefore then ſhould we be conſtreyned to ſweare that, which we forbeare to make others to ſweare?</p>
            <p>There is not one only Synod of Miniſters who would haue ſubſcribed to that article, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they would bind vs to ſweare. There is not one Conſiſtory of others, but beleeueth that they are diſcharged of their Oath of fidelity towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Catholike Princes, when they ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them in their conſciences. Of this come thoſe modificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that they haue ſo oft in their mouth, <hi>Prouided, that the King forceth vs not in our conſcience.</hi> Of this come theſe exceptions in their profeſſion of faith, <hi>So the Soueraigne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of God abide in his owne integrity.</hi> Of this came the taking of arms ſo many times againſt the Kings, when they would take from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liberty of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of this came their inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rebellions, both in <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the King of Spayne, &amp; <hi>Sweden</hi> againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> whome they ſpoiled of the Realme of <hi>Sweden</hi> his lawfull inheritance, and therin eſtabliſhed <hi>Duke Charles</hi> a Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>Neither yet do they reſtrayne theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17172:72"/>to the only caſe of religion, &amp; of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but they further extend them to ſecular matters. The writinges of <hi>Buchanan, Bruſe,</hi> and infinite others giue teſtimony, who will, that if the Kinges fayle in temporall conuentions and accord, which they haue made with their ſubiects, their ſubiectes be free to reuolt from them.</p>
            <p>Not conſidering that there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as we haue already declared, betweene faylinge in a ſimple accord, made by Oath, and deſtroying the Oath, by the which the accord was made. For when a Prince doth of frayltie, or of humane paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome iniuſtice, he doth indeed againſt the Oath he hath made to his people, to do them iuſtice; yet he doth not thereby deſtroy his Oath.</p>
            <p>But if he make a contrary Oath, that is to ſay, inſteed of what he hath publiquely and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſworne to his people, which was to do them iuſtice (to wit, as far as humaine frailty will permit) he ſhould ſweare and bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by another publique and ſolemne Oath, that he would neuer render them iuſtice, but rather ſweare, that he will miniſter nothing but iniuſtice; he ſhould then deſtroy his Oath, &amp; renounce his owne Royaltie, in renouncing by a contrary Oath the clauſes and conditions of his former oath, for which, and by meanes and occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof his Royalty was inſtituted.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:17172:73"/>
            <p> And therefore <hi>Barckley</hi> the <hi>Achilles</hi> of the doctrine of your Article, hath had moſt iuſt cauſe to reprehend, and find fault with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid authours, but in reprehending them, he hath reſerued an exception of two caſes, which make much more to the preiudice of Kinges, then do the Churches cenſures from which he would exempt them.

<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>I finde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>two caſes in which a King by fact maketh himſelf of a King no King, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelf of his royall dignity and of power ouer

For nether is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to cut it off by &amp; by, &amp; to ſeparate it from the reſt of the body, but we muſt cure it ſweetly, aſwel by good words, as otherwiſe, lyke prudent &amp; wiſe Phiſitians. There could not be any thing more againſt reaſon, &amp; of greater cruelty, then Tyrany by a ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I cal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a rebellion of the people, without cauſe, and without reaſon, which is oft tymes worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyrany &amp;c. There needeth great &amp; ſinguler diſcretion, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and temperance about the expulſion &amp; thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of tyranny, and therefore we muſt heare, and giue credit to wiſe Philoſophers. Lawyers,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17172:74"/>Deuines, to men of good life, of good and naturall prudence, &amp; of great experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of whom it is ſaid,</hi> In old men is found experience. <hi>For though a Prince and Lord ſinne in many caſes, yet he muſt not for that be preſently cenſured a Tyrant.</hi> So he there.</p>
            <p>And in his worke of ten Conſiderations againſt the flatterers of Kings, where he reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulateth a part of the diſcourſe of his Sermon,

               </note> he ſayth: <hi>It is an errour to belieue, that a terrene Prince is not bound in any thing, during his raigne, to his ſubiects. For according to diuine right and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall equity, and the end of true gouernement, as the ſubiects owe fidelity, ayd, ſuccour and ſeruice to their Lord: So the Lord oweth agayne faith and protection to his ſubiects. And if the Prince manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly purſue and perſecute them, and with obſtinacy in iniury, and by fact, then this naturall rule (It is lawfull to repell force by force: and this ſaying of</hi> Seneca, <hi>There cannot be a more acceptable Sacrifice immolated and made to God, then by taking away of a Tyrant) taketh place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding this which is more ſtrange, thoſe who haue cauſed this to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, haue not vouchſafed to add, either in the beginning of his workes, or in the margent of theſe wordes, any obſeruation, or note for the cenſuring of them, or for aduertiſement of the Reader to take heed. But indeed, how could they haue done it without condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues: Themſelues (I ſay) who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fury of theſe laſt troubles had been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne-bearers,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17172:75"/>or rather had caried the burning torches of this pernicious doctrine, and had maynteyned and publiſht it againſt King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third, by propoſitions diſputed and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? For theſe be their words: <hi>It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that by right, both diuine and naturall, the Eſtates be aboue Kings.</hi> And againe: <hi>It was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all the people of France moſt iuſtly to take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes againſt the Tyrant:</hi> that is to ſay, agaynſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the third. And a litle after: <hi>They, who conſider matters attentiuely and diligently, will iudge that the eternall enemies of the Religion, and of the Country ought to be purſued not only by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique armes, but alſo by the ſword, and plotts of particuler perſons.</hi> And that Iames Clement the Dominican, <hi>was not put forwards by any other deſire, then by the loue of the Lawes of his Country, and of the zeale of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, by which this reſtorer of our Liberty, hath put vpon his owne head grace, and vpon our neck a coller of gold, and the heauenly collers of the Church.</hi> Thus there.</p>
            <p>This I ſay not to ſcandalize them (for I conceale their names) nor to reproach them with that, that the bounty, and clemency of the King hath buried vp and forgotten; but to ſhew, that they ſhould be content to attend the reſt of their dayes, to the cancelling and waſhing away of their offence with their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and not to meddle themſelues with the making of leſſons, of the ſeruice of Kinges, to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17172:75"/>them, who alwaies well and faithfully ſerued them, euen then when they perſecuted them.</p>
            <p>But theſe are violent ſpirits, who being tranſported to one extreme, and not being of power to hold the meane, thought that the beſt meanes, for the iuſtifying of themſelues was to paſſe ouer to the other extreme, and to put their hand to pen, to write and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope. Wherin as they are found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, or at leaſt very like vnto the Churches enemies, they haue beene ſo ſet on, and plyed by thoſe our enemyes, and by ſome that diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with them, as they haue beene induced &amp; thruſt on, vnder a pretence of the Kinges ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to ſow the ſeedes of ſchiſme.</p>
            <p>But, Syrs, the King deſireth not to be ſerued after this ſort: his will is not that proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be made for his ſafety by ſchiſme, and by the Churches diuiſion: In the ruines whereof is comprehended the ruine and ouerthrow of his owne ſafetie, ſpirituall and temporall: he is a Catholike, and the eldeſt child of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church; he is the firſt Catholike of all the Kinges, and the firſt King of all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes. He feareth not to fall into Hereſy, and ſtandeth not in doubt of the Popes cenſures, nor dreadeth the Churches threates againſt Heretikes. He is the prime and principall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our of the one and the other. He is the heire both of the Crowne, and of the name, and of the faith of that glorious S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17172:76"/>Churches ſupport and piller, and the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp; retrait. He is deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from a mother no leſſe Catholike, pious, and Religious then his owne: he is inſeparable &amp; indiuiſible from the vnion and amity of the Sea Apoſtolike, &amp; doth ſeeke by all manner of reaſons, both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall, to manteyne it.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the intereſts of Eſtate fought againſt thoſe of conſcience, and bound her, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſeuered from the communion of the <hi>Pope.</hi> But all the intereſts aſwell of State as of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, bind the gratitude of our King, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue himſelfe in intelligence, correſpondence, vnion and amity with the Pope: he is beſides the Titles his predeceſſors haue gained him, a child of the Sea Apoſtolique in many ſortes. <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the Eight receaued the deceaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great his Father into the Churches boſome and lappe, he reſolued, and eſtabliſhed his mariage with the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Queene <hi>Mary de Medices,</hi> to whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, vertue, and bountie, we owe the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our new raigne, and the memory of whoſe moſt happy Regencie, al the ages of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will extoll and bleſſe. Out of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, is come the Sacred bud of our Lillyes, which <hi>Salomon</hi> did not match with all his glory: I meane the King who now raigneth. <hi>Pope Paul</hi> who ſitteth at this day in the Sea of Peter was his good Father, and as his ſecond
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17172:76"/>Father, hath imployed himſelfe by all manner of cares and good offices, to procure before God, and before Men, the conſeruation of his perſon, and of his Realme.</p>
            <p>And wherefore then ſhould we deſturbe or trouble this concord, by Lawes not only of State, but alſo of Religion, and of conſcience, which our Fathers haue not knowne? Caſt your eyes vpon the hiſtories of <hi>France,</hi> and you ſhall finde, that allwayes when our Kinges haue beene in vnion, concord and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Sea Apoſtolike, and that the Spouſe (to vſe the termes of Scripture) hath fed among the lillies; all ſortes of graces and benedictions temporall and ſpirituall haue ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and come downe vpon them, and their people; you ſhall find that as when the <hi>Arke</hi> of Couenant ſtayed and continued in the houſe of <hi>Obededom,</hi> there was not any kind of felicity wanting euen ſo, as long as the Communion of the Sea Apoſtolique hath beene amongſt vs, &amp; that we haue had the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of him, who is the true Arke of Couenant, we haue had our ſhare in al ſortes of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the name of <hi>Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> hath diſperſed it ſelf from one end of the world to the other, and our <hi>Lillyes</hi> haue extended and reached themſelues to the furtheſt remote corners of the earth.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe at what time our Kinges were ſeuered from the communion of the Sea Apoſtolique, the Lillies hath beene amidſt the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17172:77"/>thornes, and all ſortes of afflictions, and of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities haue beſieged vs. Renew within your ſelues the memory of thoſe thinges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence drawe conſequences for the tyme to come. Remember how many calamities and miſeries we haue ſuffred in tyme of Schiſmes, or apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Schiſmes; how many Churches ruyned, how many Altars pulled downe, how many Citties ſaccaged and ſpoyled. Repreſent to your eies the State of your paſſed life, the tyme that our deceaſed King was depriued of the Communion of the Apoſtolique Sea, and with how many vowes, and teares both he and you haue deſired his reſtitution. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, lay againe before your eies the ſtate of the life to come, from which the authors and fauourers of Schiſme be excluded, and whereunto none can poſſibly come, if he be not placed, not only in the faith, but alſo in the vnity, and in the communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</p>
